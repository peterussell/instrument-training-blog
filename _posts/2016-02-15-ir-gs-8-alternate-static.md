# Alternate Static Source

If the primary static port becomes clogged:

 - the airspeed indicator won't be adjusted for the current altitude
 - the altimeter will freeze
 - the VSI will read 0 FPM

The alternate static port is usually activated by a small valve, usually with a control in the cockpit (pull on). The alternate static port is located inside the cockpit, so cockpit air is now the static source for the static instruments (airspeed indicator, altimeter, VSI).

**Cabin static air pressure is slightly lower than outside air pressure.**

Results:

 - **VSI:** will temporarily show a small climb
 - **Altimeter:** will read slightly higher than its actual setting - usually less than 50'
   - *FAR Part 23 requires a correction card **in the cockpit** if the altimeter changes by more than 50' using the alternate static air*
 - **Airspeed Indicator:** will read slightly faster than your actual indicated airspeed

# Alternate, alternate static air

If both the primary static port and alternate static air are clogged or otherwise inop, you can break the face of any instrument connected to the static air system to allow air to flow in to the instrument.
