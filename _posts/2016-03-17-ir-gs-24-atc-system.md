*Note: part of the ATC system is covered in the previous post: The IFR System*

# ATC Coverage Areas

 - **ARTCC** normally control traffic starting at the IFR enroute altitude level
   - in many parts of the country, Center starts controlling traffic at approx. 6,000' MSL to Flight Level 600 (60,000' MSL, the top of the high altitude airspace structure

 - **Approach Control** (Departure Control if you're leaving the area) handles all traffic approaching and departing local airports
 - Approach/Departure Control uses ASR, or **Airport Surveillance Radar**, in busy terminal environments that handle IFR traffic all the way to the ground
 - Approach Control's jurisdiction usually ends either vertically or horizontally where Center takes over
 - Approach Control is sometimes called **TRACON**, for Terminal Radar Approach Control
   - these are often located in a separate building, and cover many terminal areas
 - there's also a **RAPCON**, for Radar Approach Control
   - these are often located in the same facility as the airport tower
   - a RAPCON can also be used as an Approach Control facility shared with a branch of the military
 - approaches exist consisting of nothing more than radar vectored guidance by controllers to a missed approach point. One of these approaches, which makes use of ASR, is called a **Surveillance Approach*, and is only available at airports where civil radar instrument approach minimums have been published (more on this later). The only required equipment for this approach is an operable transmitter and receiver
   - during a serveillance approach, the controller vectors you to the final approach course, then provides continuous vectors during the final approach
   - these vectors take you to the missed approach point
   - the controller tells you when to start your descent to the MDA, which is posed in the **Radar Instrument Approach Minimums** of the government's approach chart booklet
   - when you're at the missed approach point on this approach, the controller tells you to execute the missed approach unless you have the required minimums for landing

 - another type of radar-guided approach is conducted using **Precision Approach Radar (PAR)**
   - here, the controller provides highly accurate lateral and vertical guidance all the way down to a decision altitude, in much the same way an ILS works - it's sort of like a talking ILS

 - the above two approaches (Surveillance and Precision Approach Radar (PAR) are often only found at military airports

 - there is one other type of very useful approach that can be provided by Approach Control:

**No-Gyro Approach** (or vectors)

 - can be used if the directional gyro or compass becomes inoperative
 - you'd ask the controller for a no-gyro approach, or vectors
 - the controller will tell you when to start and stop your turn (you're expected to use standard rate turns)
 - if you're making a surveillance or precision approach, ATC will advise when you're on final, at which point you're supposed to make *half standard-rate turns* until the approach is completed
