Hold entries can be a little complicated because of the number of different places you might be trying to enter a hold from. There are three standard hold entries recommended by the FAA: **direct, parallel,** and **teardrop**. Each is used when approaching a hold from different positions relative to the hold.

A key idea to remember is that *pattern entry is always based on doing what will keep you closest to the racetrack while getting you onto the circuit.* You want the entry that gives you the *least* exposure beyond the lateral limits of the hold.

It's worth mentioning that these are *recommended* entries. If you can think up something better and remain within bounds, it's legal to fly it.

# How to Determine the Type of Entry

 1. imagine standing at the hold fix, facing so that an airplane on the *inbound* leg is coming directly at you
 2. turn 70 degrees toward the holding side of the pattern
 3. draw a line through the holding fix in the direction you're facing
   - if you're approaching anywhere on the side where the majority of the hold is, then it's a **direct** entry
   - if you're approaching from the side where the small part of the hold is (inbound to outbound turn):
     - if you're on the holding side, then it's a **parallel** entry
     - if you're on the non-holding side, then it's a **teardrop** entry

# Direct Entry

 - cross the holding fix and turn in the direction of the pattern's outbound leg (ie. pretend you just completed the inbound leg of the hold)

# Parallel Entry

 - cross the fix flying the opposite direction and parallel to the inbound leg
 - fly this for 1 minute
 - turn in the direction of the holding parrent through *more than 180 degrees* (210 degree turn is recommended), the intercept the holding course inbound

# Teardrop Entry

 - fly to the holding fix
 - turn to the outbound on a heading that's 30 degrees divergent from the direction of the outbound leg (ie. on a heading that looks like it will intercept the outbound leg, but making a 30 degree angle between it and the inbound/outbound leg)
 - fly this heading for 1 minute
 - turn to intercept the inbound leg

# Turns in the Holding Pattern

 - ATC expects you to make either:
   - standard rate turns
   - turns with a maximum of 30 degrees of bank
   - use a bank angle provided by the flight director (FD)
 - in smaller/GA airplanes, standard rate turns do a good job
