In an effort to be a little more pragmatic about I'm spending my time (especially
with [all these things to do this year][life-before-30]) I wanted some way to better
allocate and track time during the week.

[Agile][agile] is a methodology from software development that appears to fit the bill. The
concept of sprints allow you to define a time period, a number of tasks,
allocate time per task, then track progress against each task.

When you compare the 'expected' time spent on a task vs. the 'actual' time spent on a task
it's easy to tell whether you're ahead or behind of schedule. Aggregate across all
tasks (often done on a burndown chart) and you can quickly tell how much
you've lied to yourself about your superhuman abilities.

Agile encompasses many other concepts and practices, but these are the main ones I plan to use.

I'm using [Trello][trello] with a [Scrum plugin][scrum-plugin] (Scrum's a framework for Agile).
I've allocated 17 hours of work over 2 weeks, which may increase or decrease in future sprints
depending on how this trial goes. There are four categories:

 - Backlog: the task queue
 - In Progress: tasks I'm working on (ideally only one at a time, but multiple are allowed)
 - Completed: yay!
 - Blocked: anything that I can't complete due to circumstances beyond 'I'm lazy'

The Scrum plugin allows you to add a time estimate to cards in Trello along with a 'completed so far'
time on the card for each task.

I should point out that the boards aren't set up like that in Trello by default, but it is very
easy to do.

Each category I mentioned above is a Trello 'board', each task correlates to a Trello 'card',
and if any task requires more information, it's easy to add a Checklist to any of the cards to give
a breakdown of sub-tasks. 've added colored labels to each card making it easy to see if there's a particularly large
backlog of tasks in one category.

The setup took around an hour or so (including figuring out how to use it) which I consider
a small investment for what seems like it will be a useful system. I'll report back.
