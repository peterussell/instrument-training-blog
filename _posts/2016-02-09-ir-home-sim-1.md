I've been saving my pennies and have now started looking around to find a flight instructor to work on getting
my [instrument rating][before-30-ir]. I'll likely wait a bit until the weather in Portland clears up (I *still*
didn't write about the move.. I will, promise!), so I'm spending time working on the [theory portion][ir-gs]
and doing regular flights in my little home simulator to get familiar with flying on instruments and with
instrument procedures.

Flight sims may enter the realm of the pretty-damn-nerdy, but a) I'm fine with that, b) it's ideal for instrument training, and c) it's recommended by [many][recommendation-1] [flight][recommendation-2] [instructors][recommendation-3].

Today I did a short VOR flight from Stark's Twin Oaks (where I hope to train out of) to Hillsboro, via the
Battle Ground (BTG) VOR, then landed using the ILS 13R at Hillsboro.

**The Plan**

 - depart Twin Oaks on runway 02
 - intercept and track the Newberg (UBG/117.4) 013 radial outbound
 - track the Battle Ground (BTG/116.6) 013 radial inbound until over the VOR
 - track the Battle Ground 230 radial outbound
 - intercept the Hillsboro 13R ILS (I-HIO/110.7) and fly it down to land on 13R at Hillsboro (KHIO)

Usually I take off with visual reference, then re-adjust the view so that I can only see the instrument panel,
and fly until the middle marker on the ILS lights up and re-adjust again so I can see outside to land. This
- as far as I know - simulates a fairly realistic scenario of a low cloud IFR flight.
