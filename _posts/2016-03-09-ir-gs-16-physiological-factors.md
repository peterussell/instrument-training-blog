It's important to be able to identify various physiological illusions and compensate for them.

# Spatial Disorientation / Vertigo

Our sense of sight during VFR flight helps us determine the relationship between the airplane's attitude and the earth's horizon. In IFR flight that relationship gets taken away.

Without normal visual cues, the body can send unusual messages to the brain, creating a conflict between the 'seat of the pants' feeling and instrument readings. This is **Spatial Disorientation** or **vertigo**.

 - *It's important in this situation to **always** trust the instruments.*

Vertigo is caused by problems associated with our three sensory systems: vestibular, kinesthetic, and visual:

 - **Vestibular**: three semicircular canals located in the ear, each lying in a different plane which relate to roll, pitch, and yaw. They contain fluid which moves when the canal is moved. The fluid moves tiny hairs at the base of each canal, called **otolith organs**. When the hairs move in relation to either or all three canals, they alert the brain that the body is moving in that direction.

- **Kinesthetic**: information sent to the brain by our skin and deeper within the body. There is where the 'seat of the pants' flying comes from, and how G-Forces are felt.

 - **Visual**: information sent to the brain by the eyes.

# Acceleration and the Inner Ear

 - fliud in the canals has its own inertia, that is, it resists movement of the surrounding canals due to acceleration
 - the canal can be said to move around the fluid contained inside it, this is what gives the feeling of accelerating in a plane (turning, speeding up, slowing down, descending, ascending...)
 - eventually the fluid catches up to the canal and the feeling of acceleration stops, even though you're still turning you don't feel it
 - however, when you *stop* turning, the fluid's intertia resists the change in motion, so it feels like you're now in a turn in the *opposite* direction

# Common Illusions, Causes, and Effects:

 - **The Leans**
   - **Maneuver:** enter bank at a very slow rate
   - **Semicirculars:** fluid in roll-detecting tubes isn't set in motion
   - **You Feel:** bank in opposite direction when fluid moves as roll stops
 - **Coriolis Effect**
   - **Maneuver:** while in a prolonged turn, move your head in a different geometric plane
   - **Semicirculars:** fluid, already in motion, senses the direction you moved your head
   - **You Feel:** airplane turning or accelerating in a different plane to the one it really is
 - **Graveyard Spiral**
   - **Maneuver:** roll into level flight after a turn
   - **Semicirculars:** fluid keeps going
   - **You Feel:** turn in the opposite direction. You re-initiate the original turn, which drops the nose due to loss of vertical lift. You pull back on the yoke, tightening the turn, and increasing the rate of descent
 - **Somatogravic Illusion**
   - **Maneuver:** rapid forward acceleration
   - **Semicirculars:** fluid pressed backward in the semicircular canals
   - **You Feel:** airplane is nose up, and you compensate by lowering the nose
 - **Inversion Illusion**
   - **Maneuver:** sudden downard acceleration, or abrupt change from climb to straight and level
   - **Semicirculars:** fliud moves upward in canals
   - **You Feel:** airplane is inverted or tumbling backward (think of how gravity would normally pull on the fliud if you were inverted)
 - **Elevator Illusion**
   - **Maneuver:** sudden upward acceleration, such as an updraft
   - **Semicirculars:** fliud is pressed to bottom of canals
   - **You Feel:** airplane is climbing

# False Horizons

A false horizon is often a result of clouds or lights creating a horizon that's not the real horizon. The light sources could be street lights on an angle to the actual horizon, stars, or aurora borealis in some cases.

# Autokinesis

A visual illusion caused by staring at a stationary light against a dark background for several seconds. The light appears to move because of small, frequent, involuntary movements of the eye. As a result there's a temptation to align your airplane with the light's false movement. To prevent this, don't stare for long periods at stationary light sources.
