# How the FAA Builds an Approach Chart

 - Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPs) specialists construct an approach by applying FAA criteria set out in the TERPs manual (FAA Order 8260.3B) to detailed topographic and other information about the area surrounding an airport
 - the TERPs manual defines what obstacle and terrian clearance is required in a variety of circumstances
 - TERPs specialists find the nearest electronic navaid (usually an NDB or VOR) and examine how this facility could be used to safely steer and lower pilots from the enroute structure, leading them as close as possible to a runway or the runway centerline
   - with GPS it's no longer necessary to have a nearby navaid for an airport to have an instrument approach
 - once the TERPs process is complete, an FAA flight inspection team flies the newly designed approach under VFR and decides whether it is OK, needs correct, or gets scrapped completely

# Approach Chart Overview

We'll look at the chart layout used by the National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO). This is called the NACO format.

Information is placed in the order in which you're most likely to use it while flying an instrument approach, from the top down.

**Briefing Areas**

 - **Top Briefing Area:** contains procedural information, like the type of approach, navaid frequency, identification, direction, runway information, official approach name, airport name
 - **Middle Briefing Area:** takeoff/departure/alternate information, notes, limitations, approaching lighting (if applicable), a textual missed approach description
 - **Lower Briefing Area:** communication information for the approach (frequencies etc.)

**Plan View**

 - the plan view is below the briefing area
 - it shows the top-down view of the approach
 - also usually includes the Minimum Sector Altitude, or **MSA** information

**Profile View**

 - the profile view is below the plan view
 - shows a side view of the approach
 - shows the minimum altitudes you're allowed to fly along the approach course

**Airport Sketch**

 - located either to the left or right of the profile view
 - shows a basic overview of the airport layout and important airport information

**Icons**

 - located above the profile view
 - give a quick representation of what to do after reaching the Missed Approach Point **(MAP)**

**Landing Minimums**

 - located at the bottom of the chart
 - typically consists of Minimum Descent Altitudes **(MDAs)**, and minimum visibility requirements
   - the **MDA** is the lowest altitude to which you may descend while guided entirely by instruments
   - to descend lower you must have the required visibility, as well as an identification of the runway environment (more on this later)

**Time/Distance Table**

 - located at the bottom of the chart, often below the airport sketch
 - provides you with an additional source of information on how to identify the MAP
   - eg. the time it takes to fly to the MAP from a particular point along the approach course, based on a range of ground speeds
