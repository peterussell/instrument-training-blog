# Ridges and Troughs

 - **Trough:** an elongated area of **low pressure**
    - frequently delineates the boundary between two different pressure centers
    - you can consider a trough sort of like a valley with water, given the
      chance, water would flow freely into the valley - in the same way, a trough
      allows air to converge (flow into it) - the air actually flows toward the
      low pressure (trough) and rises, because it's ... well, low pressure
 - **Ridge:** an elongated area of **high pressure**
    - you can think of a ridge as a mountain of piled up, heavy, descending air
    - the circulation of air along a ridge is clockwise, but the isobars don't
      form a closed circulation
    - ridges exhibit similar characteristics to a high, with clear air and
      minimum cloudiness and precipitation

# Frontal Systems

 - a front is essentially where two air masses with different pressures meet
 - the air masses of different densities **don't mix very well**, resulting
   in the properties of a front
 - this is often where the 'weather action is' - and as a pilot often the place
   you *don't* want to be
 - frontal systems start as large air masses, which take on the properties of
   the air that they come from
 - there are four basic types of air masses in the US, made up of **continental**
   (over land), or **maritime** (over water), and **polar** (from the North
   pole), or **tropical** (from near the equator):
    1. **Continental Polar:** cold temps, low moisture content, great stability
    2. **Maritime Polar:** cold temps, high moisture, tendency to become very
       unstable when passing over warmer areas, thunderstorms possible
    3. **Continental Tropical:** dry, hot, unstable, but produce few showers due
       to their minimal moisture content
    4. **Maritime Tropical:** hot, moist, unstable, high chance of thunderstorms
       due to the latent heat energy

# The Polar Front

 - a cap of dense, cold air sits over the North Pole, which comes from the cool
   air descending at the poles
 - as this air moves south it flows *from* the east, forming a band of winds
   known as the Polar Easterlies
 - the **Polar Front is the zone between the Polar Easterlies and the warmer
   prevailing westerlies**
 - you can imagine the air mass over the pole as a big piece of Playdoh, with
   tentacles of it advancing south which pulls other pieces of it north - at
   any given time there could be between 3 to 7 south-moving 'waves'
 - these waves move quickly, and this advance and retreat is what we experience
   on the ground as *frontal movement*
 - when the polar front is **advancing** and overtaking the warmer prevailing
   westerlies, the slope of the front is very **sharp**
 - when the polar front is **retreating** and being replaced by the prevailing
   westerlies, the slope of the front is very **shallow**
 - during winter, the polar front can extend much further down toward the equator
   than in the summer where it retreats closer to the pole

# Different Types of Fronts

 - cold air overtaking warmer air
 - shown as blue arrows pointing in the direction the front is moving
 - warm air fills in the area where the cold front is pulling is energy
   front (think of the Playdoh - if it stretches out in one area it's receding
   somewhere else)
 - where the warm air is advancing due to the cold air receding is a **warm front**
 - a warm front is denoted by 'sweat beads' - red half circles pointing in the
   direction the front is moving
 - a **stationary front** is created when warm and cold air butt up against each
   other and neither moves, denoted by the icicles and sweat beads along the
   same line but *facing away from each other*
 - an **occluded front** occurs when a cold front catches up to a warm front and
   lifts the air ahead of it, denoted by the icicles and sweat beads along the
   same line and *facing in the same direction*
 - in almost all cases these result in poor flying conditions
 - **pressure falls as fronts approach** - this is because fronts are often found
   along low-pressure troughs

**Air Masses in a Front**

 - as cold air and warm air approach each other, the cold air is more dense so it
   easily slips underneath the warm air and pushes it upward
 - the warm air often contains more moisture and latent heat, which is released
   as it rises, further increasing the low pressure along (ahead of) the front
 - once the cold air reaches the observer on the ground, the pressure will
   increase again due to the higher density of the air
 - the main idea is that the cold air is responsible for initially lifing the warm
   air, but the *act* of the warm air rising is itself responsible for further
   decreasing the pressure leading the front

**Remember: a trough line is an area of low pressure with high pressure on either
side, and where the isobars form a counterclockwise curvature but don't form a
closed circulation.**

**One other important point is that Polar Fronts (high pressure) are *drawn to
low pressure troughs.*** This means that if you see a trough near a high pressure
polar front area, then you can expect that (or any high pressure area?) to move
toward the trough, kind of like teasing a horse along with a carrot.

# Discontinuities Across a Front

 - recall that a front is a boundary or transition zone between air masses having
   different properties, as you cross a front these properties change, or become
   'discontinuous'
 - air at higher altituds is more homogenous, so you're more likely to notice
   the changes across a front at lower altitudes
 - a few properties that you can expect to change:
    - temperature
    - air pressure (you could check airports along the route to verify the front)
    - dewpoint (warmer air can hold more water molecules before becoming saturated)
    - wind direction and speed
    - visibility

# Cold Front Characteristics

 - a cold air mass overtaking a warm air mass is called a cold front
 - cold air, being heaver, pushes warm air up like a bulldozer
 - because of its consistency and surface friction, the cold air tends to *stick*
   to the surface, creating a steeply sloped frontal edge
    - faster moving cold fronts have steeper frontal edges than slow moving ones
    - cold frontal slopes range from 1/50 (steep) to 1/150 (not steep) - meaning
      that at 1 mile in altitude, you have to travel horizontally 50 miles (in the
      case of 1/50) from where the leading edge of the front meets the ground to
      meet the edge of the front at an altitude of 1 mile
 - in the Northern Hemisphere, cold fronts are normally oriented **NE to SW**, and
   move toward the east or southeast
 - the **cloudiness and weather** associated with the front depends on the
   **stability and moisture** of the air being pushed up ahead of the front

**Two Types of Cold Fronts**

Cold fronts can be generally divided into fast-moving and slow-moving:

 - **Fast Moving Cold Front**
    - have been clocked in excess of 60 MPH (you could be overtaken on the
      freeway), although they usually move about half that speed
    - their speed is generally faster in winter
    - given the most of the weather occurs at the leading edge of the front, the
      high speed of this leading edge of a fast moving front usually results in
      the most dramatic weather (and hazardous to pilots)
    - couple a fast moving front with unstable moist air, and you have thunderstorms,
      cumulonimbus (nimbus = rain) and rain showers in advance of the front
    - fast moving cold fronts can general **squall lines** (lines of thunderstorms)
      30 - 180 miles in advance of and parallel to the front
 - **Slow Moving Cold Front**
    - generally create less hazardous weather
    - the slower moving air creates a shallower slope, with less intense lifting
      of the air preceding it
    - **precipitation and cloud formation occurs in a broad band *behind* the
      cold front's surface position**
    - because of the slower lifting, stratiform clouds can form if the air in front
      is relatively stable, and fog can also form in the rainy area
    - unstable air can still form cumulus clouds and thunderstorms, but in a
      relatively narrow band (as opposed to squall lines hundreds of miles in front)

# Warm Front Characterstics

 - warm fronts are typically associated with the small wave patterns moving along
   the polar front
 - they're created by the retreating high pressure air being replaced by warmer,
   low pressure air
 - warm front orientation is more north-south, or more northwest-southeast
 - the cold air tugging the warm air along creates a long shallow slope over which
   the **warm air rises as it gradually replaces the cold air**
 - because the cooler air is generally reluctant to give way to the warmer air,
   warm fronts **typically move very slowly, around 10 - 15 MPH**
 - warm front **slopes** typically range from 1/50 to 1/200, with an average of
   1/100
    - a shallower slope generally means that a warm front is generally spread over
      a larger area than a cold front
 - **if the rising air is warm and stable** then stratiform clouds develop on the
   warm front
 - the **cloud formation sequence along a warm front is** cirrus, cirrostratus,
   altostratus, nimbostratus
 - precipitation increases gradually with the approach of a warm front, and
   generally stops when it passes
 - it's not unusual to have thunderstorms embedded in the stratus clouds if the
   air mass is warm, moist, and unstable
 - widespread precipitation ahead of the warm front generally creates fog and
   low stratus, because the precipitation raises the humidity (water content)
   of the air to saturation, this and other effects produce **poor visibility
   over a wide area**
 - if the retreating cold front has below zero temperatures, then the result can
   be **freezing rain or ice pellets** (freezing rain is especially dangerous
   for pilots because it accumulates quickly)
    - this occurs because the precipitation in the warm front aloft is water, but
      when it falls through the cold retreating high pressure area it freezes
    - in fact, freezing rain, ice pellets, or heavy, wet snow can be good
      indications of warmer temperatures aloft

# Stationary Front Characteristics

 - occurs when the opposing forces of air masses with different densities and
   similar strengths meet, and little or no movement occurs
 - wind on either side of the front **blows parallel to it, rather than across
   it**
 - they're seldom *actually* stationary, but usually move at a speed less than
   5 knots
 - weather is similar to a warm front, but it's less intense because very little
   liftin occurs
 - stationary fronts can often remain in the same area for days

# Jet Streams

 - the jet streams consist of **one or more tubes of very fast moving air from
   west to east across the US**
 - it does several things:
    - high altitude winds direct storm track movement across the US
    - provide tailwinds for pilots in an easterly direction

To understand how jet streams form, we need to know more about the **tropopause**.

 - the **tropopause** is the boundary between the **tropospher**, where most
   of our weather occurs, and the **stratosphere**, where very little weather
   occurs
 - **temperatures decrease until reaching the tropopause**
    - above the tropopause, temperatures remain steady, and then start to *increase*
 - the tropopause tends to **bulge near the equator**, making a short fat elipse
   surrounding the spherical earth
    - normally it's around *30,000' at the northern latitudes**, and bulges to
      **65,000' at the equator**, and around **18,000' to 26,000' at the equator**
    - it bulges because the **warmer air at the equator expands slightly**
 - the strong vertical temperature gradient can cause large differences in
   pressure, resulting in **a bulging or a tear in the tropopause**
    - this occurs because warm air expands and cool air shrinks, resulting in great
      pressure differences, which cause a tear in the tropopause
 - warm tropical air can escape out of the hole in the tropopause, and move
   toward the pole where it cools and sinks back down under the tropopause again
 - as it circulates upward and downard, it's turned to the right by the Coriolis
   force, which gives the air a west to east motion

**Jet streams are usually found at or near the polar front (where the pressure
difference is at its greatest), and winds can be in excess of 200 MPH.**

 - jet streams can have the affect of creating either high pressure (if they're
   pushing down air) or low pressure (if they're sucking up air) at places on
   the earth, which can affect other weather patterns.
