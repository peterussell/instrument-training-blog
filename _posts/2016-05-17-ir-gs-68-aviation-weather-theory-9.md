# Icing

Aside from thunderstorms, structural icing is an instrument pilot's biggest in-flight concern. Test data
shows that ice, snow, or frost having a **thickness and roughness similar to sandpaper can reduce lift up
to 30% and increase drag by up to 40%.**

Icing is one area where the standard lapse rate of 2.0 deg C (3.5 deg F) is useful - you can use it to
estimate where the freezing level begins.

*For example, assume your field elevation is 1,350' MSL with a temperature of +8 deg C. At what altitude
would you find the freezing level?*

 - with a lapse rate of 2 deg C per 1,000', that means the freezing level is 4,000' above the field
   elevation
 - therefore, a reasonable estimate of the freezing level is 5,350' MSL

**The Two Coniditions for Icing**

Two conditions must be met for structural ice to form and stay on your airplane:

 1. **Visible Moisture**
     - the airplane must be flying through visible moisture, such as rain or cloud droplets
 2. **Below Freezing**
     - the temperature at the point where the moisture makes contanct with the airplane must be below freezing

Avoid either of these conditions and you avoid ice.

# Clear and Rime Ice - Quality vs. Quantity

 - icing comes in two basic forms: **clear ice** and **rime ice**
 - the *type * of ice that forms often has to do with the presence of **supercooled water droplets**
    - supercooled water droplets are droplets that are cooled well below their freezing point because
      of their motion and their travels in the clouds that produced them
 - **once supercooled water droplets hit a collecting surface, part of the drop freezes instantaneously**
    - the remaining part of the drop freezes more slowly due to the latent heat released by the fusion
      of the droplet to the surface
    - aerodynamic effects determine how the remaining portion of the drop freezes
 - as a result, you're likely to see two basic types of structural ice

**Clear Ice**

 - forms when **droplets are large**, as in rain or cumuliform clouds
 - clear ice forms when, after initial impact, **the remaining liquid portion of the drop flows over the
   aircraft surface, gradually freezing as a smooth sheet of solid ice**
 - clear ice is hard, heavy, and tenacious
 - even with deicing equipment (eg. boots), removal of this ice is often difficult

**Rime Ice**

 - form when **droplets are small**, as in straitified clouds or light drizzle
 - the **liquid portion remaining after initial impact freezes rapidly**, before the drop has time to
   spread over the aircraft surface
 - the small frozen droplets trap air between them, giving a **white appearance**
 - compared to clear ice, **rime ice is lighter in weight and its weight is of little significance**
    - however, its irregular shape and rough surface are very effective at changing the aerodynamic
      efficiency of airfoils, thus reducing lift and increasing drag
 - rime ice is more brittle and easily removed than clear ice

**Mixed Clear and Rime Icing**

 - mixed structural icing occurs when drops vary in size, or when liquied drops are intermingled with
   snow or ice particles
 - the mixture can form rapidly, as ice particles become embedded in clear ice
 - it builds in a very rough accumulation that sometimes takes on a mushroom shape on leading edges

**Icing Intensities**

 - it's important to understand that **all clouds at subfreezing temperatures are potential ice makers**
 - the *amount* and *rate* however depends on **drop size**, **drop distribution**, and **aerodynamic
   effect** of the airplane
    - if there are many large, supercooled water droplets present, the potential for hazardous icing
      exists
    - on the other hand, an equal or lesser number of small droples favors a slower rate of icing
    - you'll often find **smaller droplets** in **fog** and **low level clouds**, drizzle or very light
      rain is good evidence of small droplets, or no precipitation at all
    - **the most common icing in lower level stratus clouds is rime**
 - the abundance of water and large drop size found in **thick extensive stratified clouds** (eg.
   altostratus and nimbostratus) produce continuous rain and could produce serious icing
 - in **thick stratified clouds** the concentration of water is normally greater with warmer temperatures
    - thus, the area with the **heaviest icing will usually be found at or slightly above the freezing
      level, where the temperature is no more than a few degrees above freezing**
    - in *layer type clouds*, continuous icing conditions are rarely found to exist more than 5,000' above
      the freezing level, and are usually 2,000 to 3,000' thick
 - in **cumuliform clouds** the upward currents produce conditions favorable for the formation and support
   of many large water droplets
    - when your airplane enters the heavy water concentrations found in cumuliform clouds, **the large drops
      break and spread rapidly over the leading edge of the airfoil, forming a film of water**
    - **if temperatures are freezing or colder, the water freezes quickly to form a solid sheet of clear
      ice**
    - therefore, a good rule is to avoid cumuliform clouds under these conditions
    - also keep in mind that no PIREPS doesn't mean it's not there, just that no one else was dumb enough
      or brave enough to go into it

**Escaping Icing**

 - the initial thought might be to try and climb above the icing, however with the reduced performance
   in an already small/relatively underpowered airplane, you want to make *sure* that you can outclimb
   the icing
 - unless you're sure you know exactly where the tops are and that you are able, in your less-than-ideal
   condition, that you can get to that level, it's probably not a good idea to climb
 - descending to lower altitudes where the temperatures are above freezing is probably a much better idea,
   or turning back or diverting
