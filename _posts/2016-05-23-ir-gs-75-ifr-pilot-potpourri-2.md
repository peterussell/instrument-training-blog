# Wake Turbulence

 - wake turbulence can be any form of airplane generated distrubance of the atmosphere
 - the most common and hazardous type of wake turbulence is **wingtip vortices**
    - an airplane caught in these vortices can experience a rolling motion so severe
      that there isn't enough control to fight it - they can even roll a small airplane
      inverted
 - wingtip vortices are *an unwanted byproduct of lift* - they're a byproduct of the
   differential pressure over and under a wing's surfaces
    - high pressure air under the wing attempts to sneak over the tip of the wing, toward
      the low pressure air above
    - the vortex **starts under the wing, moves outward, upward, and inward toward the
      fuselage**
 - stronger vortices are produced by heavier airplanes (which occurs because they produce
   more lift in order to stay aloft)
 - **the strongest vortices are produced by a *cleanly-configured airplane at a slow
   airspeed** (slower speed = higher angle of attack = greater pressure differential)
 - airplanes to particularly avoid the vortices of are:
    - 747s
    - 757s
    - 767s
    - DC-10s

**When and Where to Expect Vortices**

 - vortices are produced from the moment the airplane leaves the ground, until the point
   where it's on the ground again
    - **if you're departing** behind a large airplane, **lift off *before* the point where
      that airplane rotated**
    - after liftoff, avoid flying the same path as the larger airplane - it's incredibly
      unlikely that flying in a small airplane you'll be able to outclimb the larger one
    - ** if you're arriving** behind a large airplane, **touch down beyond the point where
      the other airplane landed**

**Vortex Movement**

 - once free of the wing, vortices tend to **descend at a rate of several hundred feet per
   minute, and normally level off at 500-1,000' below the generating airplane**
 - they also tend to remain **a little less than a wingspan apart**
 - they **drift with the wind**

***It's always wise to avoid the area 1,000' below a large airplane.*** Maneuver laterally
(preferably upwind) to avoid flying below and behind them.

**Crosswinds at the Airport**

 - when vortices sink to 100 to 200' above the ground, they tend to move sideways at a speed
   of 2 to 3 knots
 - a crosswind will *decrease the sidways movement of the upwind* vortex, and *increase the
   movement of the downwind vortex* (this makes sense when you consider that they're trying
   to move away from each other)
 - **expect the upwind vortex to remain over or near the touchdown zone if a light crosswind
   of 1 - 5 knots exists**
 - **a light quartering tailwind can move the vortices into the touchdown zone** - a light
   headwind will tend to push them backward toward the threshold making them less of a risk
 - be especially vigilant when departing on **parallel runways with a large airplane  on the
   upwind runway** - the vortices can drift directly into your flight path
 - also be *particularly* weary if a large airplane makes a low approach, missed approach, or
   a go-around

# ATC Wake Turbulence Separation Requirements

 - for the purposes of separation, ATC classifies aircraft as *heavy*, *large*, and *small*
    - **heavy** are aircraft capable of takeoff weights greater than 255,000lbs
    - **large** are aircraft of more than 41,000lbs maximum certified takeoff weight
    - **small** are 41,000lbs or less maximum certified takeoff weight
 - if you're landing a *small* airplane behind a *heavy*, ATC will provide **at least 6
   mile separation** between you at the time it crosses the runway threshold
    - if you're following but *not landing*, ATC will keep you either **1,000' below, or
      5 miles behind** the heavy
 - when **departing behind a heavy**, ATC will provide a **2 minute wait for wake
   turbulence** (or 5 mile separation mentioned above)
    - as PIC you can opt to waive the wait, but that would be kind of dumb
 - taking off from a runwa intersection or crossing runway after a heavy poses major risks
   as well, be vigilant

# ATIS

 - designed to be reachable **within 60NM, and up to 25,000' AGL** from the ATIS site

# Misc. Communications

 - **resume own navigation** means to use the navigation equipment in your airplane to **fly
   the route shown in your last ATC clearance** (note this doesn't have any impact on
   radar reporting etc.)
 - if ATC says **radar contact lost** or **radar service terminated**, it means you are no
   longer under ATC radar surveillance, and must resume position reports at compulsory
   reporting points

# Practice Instrument Approaches

 - there's a provision in the ATC system that allows you to fly an instrument approach in VFR
   conditions without having to file IFR, it's called a **Practice Instrument Approach**,
   which is technically a VFR activity
 - to practice instrument approaches in VFR conditions, just ask the controller for a practice
   approach - use that specific phrase and the controller will know this will be a VFR operation
 - **to be absolutely clear: a practice approach is *not an IFR clearance***
    - if you're unable to maintain VFR conditions, you would need to either terminate, or request
      and receive an IFR clearance to be legal
 - when requesting a practice approach, advise the facility **the type of practice approach and
   how it will terminate** (full stop, touch-and-go, missed, low approach)
 - you **can perform practice approaches by yourself in VFR** - obviously if you're using a
   view limiting device then you need a safety pilot though

**Important Note about the Missed Approach**

 - VFR aircraft practicing instrument approaches are **not automatically authorized to execute
   a missed approach procedure**
    - if you want to execute the missed approach, then you must specifically request and receive
      permission from the controller to do so
    - aircraft separation will not be provided unless the missed approach has been approved
      by ATC

**Deviations from a Practice Approach**

 - when flying a practice instrument approach, you *must not, except in an emergency, deviate
   from the approved procedure until cleared to do so by the controller*

# Traffic Alerting/Avoidance Systems

 - there are three categories of traffic alerting/avoidance systems:
    1. **Category 1 - TCAD:** distance and altitude (no bearing or direction)
    2. **Category 2 - TAS, TIS, ADS-B, TIS-B:** distance, bearing, direction of flight, altitude,
       climbs or descents
    3. **Category 3 - TCAS:** mostly used in jets, three variations:
        - **TCAS 1:** distance, bearing, direction of flight, altitude
        - **TCAS 2:** TCAS 1 + climbing or descending, as well as telling *you* to climb or descend
          to resolve the conflict - "resolution advisories"
        - **TCAS 3:** TCAS 2 + providing resolution advisories in the horizontal direction too


# Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)

 - TCAS works through an antenna that sends and receives *transponder interrogation signals*
 - after an interrogating pulse is sent to another airplane's transponder by the antenna, the
   target airplane's transponder receives and returns the signal (it has been *interrogated*, so
   to speak)
 - the return signal is received by the TCAS antenna in such a way that the target airplane's
   direction can be identified
    - full details are too complex to note here, but the idea is the antenna is laid out in two
      dimensions, and different parts of the antenna receive the signal at different times
 - the TCAS electronics calculate the target's direction and distance, along with altitude,
   from its Mode C/S transponder
 - **the key point is that an airplane without an operating transponder won't show up on anyone's
   TCAS**
    - if the target plane's transponder is operating in Mode A (eg. because they don't have their
      transponder set to ALT), then the altitude won't be shown on the TCAS unit

# Traffic Advisory System (TAS)

 - similar to TCAS in that it's an active system that interrogates the transponders of other
   aircraft to provide distance, bearing, and altitude
 - doesn't provide resolution advisories (similar to TCAS 1)
 - the main difference between these and TCAS is essentially just the cost

# Traffic Collision Alerting Device (TCAD)

 - less common these days
 - these systems are often referred to as 'passive', or 'listening' systems in that they listen
   for a transponder that's already being interrogated
 - for systems like this to work, you must be in an area where transponders on aircraft are being
   interrogated by ATC radar, or by the TCAS/TAS systems on other aicraft
 - once the TCAD identifieds a target's transponder reply to someone else's interrogation, it
   typically displays the target's altitude and distance from you (doesn't display bearing or
   direction of flight)
 - there is no avoidance or resolution advisory with a TCAD
 - TCADs are relatively inexpensive

# Traffic Information Service (TIS)

 - provides traffic information in terms of distance, bearing, direction of flight, and altitude
 - doesn't provide resolution advisories
 - TIS requires your airplane have a **Mode S transponder** and some means of presenting target
   information (like a moving map)
 - also requires you be within range of a **ground station**
 - **a Mode S transponder** does the same as a Mode A and C transponder and a bit more
    - **Mode S has the capability of *uplinking the transponder data from other airplanes to your
      cockpit via the ground station***

**How TIS Works**

 - the ground based stations collect information on all transponder equipped aircraft (in Mode A,
   C, or S)
 - the ground stations then uplink this information to your airplane's Mode S transponder
 - the information is then displayed on a moving map display
 - the moving map shows altitude, direction, distance from you, as well as it's vector line
   (direction of flight)
 - keep in mind this is a **passive system** - the ground station is doing all the work
 - a major drawback is ground coverage - less than 25% (at the writing of the text) of the
   continental US has TIS ground station coverage, and this number appears to be decreasing

# Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B and TIS-B)

 - ADS-B uses the **Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT)**
   to interface with a multi-function cockpit display
 - the UAT is mounted on your airplane, and transmits, receives, and decodes ADS-B messages sent
   from other airplanes and from ADS-B ground stations (called Ground Based Transmitters, or GBTs)
 - this data link broadcasts your aircraft's position, velocity, projected track (**all from GPS**)
   and flight identification to other ADS-B equipped aircraft in the area, as well as GBTs
 - *ADS-B allows airplane to airplane information exchange*
 - ADS-B does *not* currently provide resolution advisories
 - the GBTs are **also able to uplink the traffic information shown on ATC's secondary surveillance radar**,
   so (along with other ADS-B traffic), you can see other Mode A/C/S equipped targets that the controller
   can see on their radar screen
    - this has a special name, called **TIS-B, or *Traffic Information Service-Broadcast***

**Advantages of ADS-B**

 - does not seriously degrade with range, atmospheric conditions, or target altitude
 - update intervals do not depend on the rotational speed or reliability of mechanical antennas
 - a relatively simple, cost-effective technology
 - works well at low altitudes, on the ground, in remote areas, and mountainous terrain where there's
   often no radar coverage

**Unless there's an imminent conflict requiring immediate action, *any deviation from an ATC clearance
based on an electronically displayed target must be approved by ATC prior to commencing the maneuver***.

A deviation made on your own without informing ATC could place your airplane in close proximity to another
aircraft under ATC control (one that's perhaps not visibile on your electronic display). This could result
in a pilot deviation action, since you're expected to maintain your assigned altitude +/- 300' while
flying IFR.

The exception here is with TCAS II or TCAS III units - in which case you should maneuver based on their
*resolution advisories*. Once that's done, you're expected to **notify ATC of that deviation ASAP**,
and then return to your assigned altitude, heading, and/or route.

# Minimum Fuel Advisory

There is a procedure for alerting the controller to a low fuel situation without actually declaring
an emergency, or obtain priority handling. It's called a **Minimum Fuel Advisory**.

 - when you realize that the fuel on board will permit approximately zero delay after reaching your
   destination, tell the controller that you **have "minimum fuel"**
    - this isn't declaring an emergency, it's just an advisory that if there's any undue delay along
      the way, it could *become* an emergency
 - the **correct phraseology** is "Bay Approach, 2132 Bravo, minimum fuel"
