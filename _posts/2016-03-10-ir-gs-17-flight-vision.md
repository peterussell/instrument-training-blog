# The Eye

Light passes through the pupil and lens, then falls on the retina at the back of the eye. The light sensing part
of the eye is made up of individual cells, called rods and cones.

 - **Cones:**
   - concentrated in a small area in the center of the retina called the **fovea**
   - the density of cells decreases as they move away from the center point of the fovea
   - only light which falls on the fovea can send the brain a sharp, clearly focused image. Light falling outside the fovea is less detailed.
   - **cones perceive colour**
   - **cones don't work well when it's dark**, which is why it's harder to perceive colour at night

 - **Rods:**
   - rod cells are concentrated on the outside of the fovea
   - **dim-light receptors**
   - responsible for peripheral vision
   - moving images are more easily detected by rod cells than cone cells
   - the fact that the rod cells work better at night explains why we have a blind spot in the center of our vision at night time, think of looking directly at a star vs. viewing it off-center

# Night Vision

 - how well you see at night is determined by the amount of light passing through the pupil
 - pupils can open and close, open to let in more light in the dark, close to prevent too much light getting through
 - **it can take 30 minutes for your eyes to completely adapt to the dark**
   - they can achieve a moderate degree of dark adaptation within 20 minutes under dim red cockpit lighting
   - this is why you want to avoid bright lights for at least 30 minutes before takeoff
 - if you have to use or look at a bright light, try closing one eye so it remains adapted to low light

**The Parallax Effect**

 - a visual illusion where the position of an object in 3D space *appears* to change due to a change in position of the observer
 - for example, many pilots have mistaken Venus to be another airplane
 - more likely to occur when there are few or no visible references to the horizon

**Aging and Night Vision**

 - night vision ability declines with age, due to a reduction in pupil size, and to do with how rod chemicals work
   - rods contain a chemical called rhodopsin. Photons fall on this chemical at night, causing it to split into two chemicals: retinal and opsin, which signal the light to the brain. The chemicals eventually recombine.
   - with age, the length of time for the chemicals to recombine increases, which means there's less rhodopsin in the rods to detect light photons
 - colour and contrast perception also decline with age, making it harder to discern objects and their colour at night. Blues and blue-greens are particularly affected.
 - the ability of the lens to bend and focus an image sharply on the retina also deteriorates with age, often why glasses are required as you get older

# Haze and Collision Avoidance

 - **all objects appear farther away in hazy conditions**
 - wearing yellow lens sunglasses is often recommended for hazy or smoggy conditions, they help define and increase contrast of objects

# Scanning for Traffic During the Day

 - when you are in VMC (even on an IFR flight plan), you are still responsible for *see and avoid*
 - a military study suggests that a 17 second cycle is best for splitting time inside and outside the cockpit: 3 seconds inside, and 14 seconds outside

**The (Outside) Scan**

 - objects are difficult to detect when the eye is in motion
 - to scan effectively, hold the eye in a stationary position for a short period of time
 - therefore, scan by moving eyes in a series of short, regularly spaced movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the centra visual field.
 - FAA suggests 10 degree movements, with each area being observed for at least 1 second
 - **Empty Field Myopia**:
   - this occurs when there's nothing specific to focus on, often above a cloud or haze layer
   - the eyes find a comfortable focal distance, usually about 10 to 30 feet, which makes it difficult to detect objects at a much further focal range
   - to overcome the problem, attempt to focus on an object in the distance (on the ground if possible) before returning to the scan

**Stationary Targets**

 - if you see a target which has no apparent motion, it's either coming directly toward you or moving directly away from you
 - in either case, it's best to make an evasive maneuver just in case

**Night Scanning for Traffic**

 - airplanes are easier to spot at night, but may not be easier to determine their direction without position lights
 - **Position Lights** are required from sunset to sunrise
   - Left Wingtip: steady red light
   - Right Wingtip: steady green light
   - Tail (facing rearward): steady white light
