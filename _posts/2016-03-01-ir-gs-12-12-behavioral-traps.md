# Types of Decisions

There are two types of decisions:

 - time constrained
   - best handled by training
   - *examples: engine fire; icing;*
 - not time constrained
   - time to carefully consider all available information
   - *examples: secondary radio failure in IMC; something wrong during pre-flight;*

Important things to remember:

 - know how to handle the most common in-flight emergencies
 - overcome the temptation to please passengers or other people
 - never try to save an airplane at the risk of human injury

# Factors That Influence Decisions

 - **Knowledge**
   - acquired during flight training and ongoing education
   - *examples: how to anticipate, detect, avoid icing conditions; how to pick suitable alternate airports;*

 - **Skill**
   - the practical aspect of instrument flying
   - requires constant practice
   - *examples: ability to fly on instruments, handle charts, talk to ATC*

# 12 Common Behavioral Traps

 1. **Peer Pressure**
   - poor decision making due to emotional response to peers, as opposed to evaluating the situation subjectively
   - *eg. promised to fly friends but weather is below personal minimums*
 2. **Mindset**
   - inability to recognize and cope with situations which differ from those planned
   - *eg. briefer said it should be calm wind at the destination, but it's actually 30 gusting 40 knots*
 3. **Get-There-Itis**
   - desire to begin or continue a flight despite dangerous conditions
   - *eg. planning to fly to meet someone for lunch, but only getting 3 hours sleep the night before*
 4. **Duck-Under Syndrome**
   - descending just below minimums to see whether you can see the runway
   - *eg. "I know I'm at minimums, but if I just descend 50 more feet I know I'll be able to see the runway"*
 5. **Scud Running**
   - flying below low clouds or other obscuring layers in an attempt to maintain visual contact with the terrain
 6. **Continuing VFR into IMC**
   - often done by instrument rated pilots, especially if rated but not current, following the logic that "if I get into IMC, I'm instrument rated so I'll be fine"
 7. **Getting Behind the Airplane**
   - occurs when pilots allow events or situations to control their actions, not the other way around
   - characterized by being constantly surprised by what happens next
 8. **Loss of Situational or Positional Awareness**
   - often related to getting behind the airplane
   - characterized by not knowing where you are, or failing to recognize deteriorating circumstances
   - can lead to accepting an incorrect or dangerous ATC instruction
   - important to always know where you are, and what the current situation is (WX, fuel, alternates, etc.)
 9. **Operating Without Adequate Fuel Reserves**
   - often a result of overconfidence, lack of flight planning, or contempt for regulations (or all 3)
   - be wary of how changes in wind, routing delays etc. would affect the situation (ie. have situational awareness)
 10. **Descent Below Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA)**
   - this is the 'Duck-Under' trap during enroute flight
   - manifests itself as flying 'just under the MEA for just a little while'
   - keep in mind there's a minimum for a reason
 11. **Flying Outside the Envelope**
   - pushing the airplane beyond what it can do
   - often results from thinking there's a large safety margin built into performance calculations (there is some, but not *that* much)
 12. **Neglect of Flight Planning**
   - includes all elements of preflight planning: weather, airports, briefings, inspections, checklists
   - *eg. failing to have current charts; failing to do wind calculations because you've flown the route before;*
   - need to be aware that familiarity results in complacency
