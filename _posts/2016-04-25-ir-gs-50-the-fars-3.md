# Visual Flight Rules

# FAR 91.155 - Basic VFR Weather Minimums

 - [FAR 91.155][far-91-155]
 - even as an IFR pilot, it's important to know VFR weather minimums so you know when or if you can
   cancel your IFR flight plan, or know what the circumstances are that you're allowed to continue
   flying in VMC if you need to get out of IMC
 - another example is when you want to go to an airport without an IAP - you might file to a nearby
   airport, then cancel when you're close enough to the actual destination and fly VFR to the destination.
   In this case it's important to know what the VFR minimums are

**Summary of VFR Weather Minimums**

# Controlled Airspace

 - **Class A**
    - Visibility: N/A
    - Cloud Clearance: N/A
 - **Class B**
    - Visibility: 3SM
    - Cloud Clearance: Clear of Clouds
 - **Class C**
    - Visibility: 3SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 500' below, 2000' horizontal
 - **Class D**
    - Visibility: 3SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 500' below, 2000' horizontal
 - **Class E** (less than 10,000')
    - Visibility: 3SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 500' below, 2000' horizontal
 - **Class E** (at or above 10,000')
    - Visibility: 5SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 1000' below, 1SM horizontal

# Uncontrolled Airspace **(Class G)**

 - **1200' or less AGL - regardless of MSL** - DAY
    - Visiblity: 1SM
    - Cloud Clearance: clear of clouds
 - **1200' or less AGL - regardless of MSL** - NIGHT
    - Visibility: 3SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 500' below, 2000' horizontal
 - **More than 1200' AGL, less than 10,000' MSL** - DAY
    - Visibility: 1SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 500' below, 2000' horizontal
 - **More than 1200' AGL, less than 10,000' MSL** - NIGHT
    - Visibility: 3SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 500' below, 2000' horizontal
 - **Above 1200' AGL and 10,000' MSL** - DAY and NIGHT
    - Visibility: 5SM
    - Cloud Clearance: 1000' above, 1000' below, 1SM horizontal

# Class G, Night Traffic Pattern Exception

 - FAR 91.155(b) says that if you're in the traffic pattern (within 1/2 mile of the runway), at *night*,
   then you're allowed a **visibility of 1SM and clear of clouds**.

# FAR 91.157 - Special VFR Minimums

 - [FAR 91.157][far-91-157]
 - apply to the airspace defined by the upward extension of the lateral bounds of Class B, C, D, or E
   surface area around an airport, below 10,000' MSL
 - a **day** special VFR requires:
    - an ATC clearance
    - **1SM visiblity**
    - **clear of clouds**
 - a **night** special VFR requires:
    - an Instrument Rating, and current
    - aircraft equipped to fly under IFR
 - some airports may not allow SVFR, this will be noted in the Chart Supplement (formerly A/FD) or on the
   sectional/terminal chart as "NO SVFR" in the legend or above the airport name
