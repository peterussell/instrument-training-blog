# Weather - Getting the Details

 - at this point you want to get a little more specific by checking the **area
   forecast** and any **AIRMETs* and **SIGMETs**
    - AIRMETs and SIGMETs essentially *amend the area forecast*
    - this is why we look at the area forecast first, then check to see whether
      it's been amended, this gives us a good idea of how the weather's evolving

# Area Forecast

**Synopsis**

 - gives us the valid times, and an overall view of the major points to note about
   the different types of weather included in the area forecast

**Clouds and Weather**

 - gives the location and types of clouds (SCT, BKN etc. with tops and bottoms),
   CB (cumulonimbus) tops, rain (types, locaton), and thunderstorm activity

We want to compare the area forecast to the prog charts to help us develop a
three-dimensional idea of where the cloud coverage might be changing.

# Weather Depiction Chart

 - gives more information about the cloud coverage along our route
 - includes station models which show the cloud coverage at WX stations, with
   ceilings in AGL above the stations
 - also shows you areas of VFR weather, which is good in case you have a complete
   electrical failure in IMC while on the way - at least you'll have a general
   direction to head

# Radar Summary Chart

 - can be used along with the Weather Depiction Chart (which shows us cloud, but
   not radar returns) to find out where the water is
 - we look at the radar echoes to determine the Levels (as talked about earlier)
 - although it's an *observation*, and can be an hour or more old, it does tell
   you about the present convective potential of the air

The secret to obtaining a three-dimensional image of how the atmosphere looks is
to mentally superimpose the radar summary chart on top of the weather depiction
chart. This allows you to have a rough idea of how extensive the cloud coverage
is horizontally, and how extensive the water is vertically.

 - Weather Depiction Chart = cloud coverage horizontally
 - Radar Summary Chart = water vertically

# AIRMETs

 - we'll cover the different types of AIRMETs in the weather chapters
 - AIRMETs are for **significant weather additions to the area forecast**
 - issued for a **maximum 6 hour period**
 - it's worth noting that Zulu is for Freezing and Ice, so its particularly
   important for an IFR flight to note these
 - Airmet Tango is for turbulence
 - Airmet Sierra is for Mountain Obscuration and IFR (CLG < 1,000' and/or vis
   < 3SM for > 50% of the affected area)

# PIREPs

 - PIREPs provide valuable information about what the weather is actually
   doing, as well as the implied information about whether anyone is actually
   flying in the weather at all
 - one place to get PIREPs is the NWS's Aviation Digital Data Service (ADDS) on
   the Aviation Weather Center website
 - remember, a lack of PIREPs could either indicate that no one's provided one,
   or that *no one's flying*A

# Terminal Forecast

 - provides a forecast for an environment closer to the airport
 - we'll cover these in more detail in the weather section

# FDC NOTAMs

 - 'FDC' NOTAMs are National Flight Data Center NOTAMs that are *regulatory
   changes affecting instrument charts*
 - even if there's no NOTAM for the IAP you expect to fly, you should still check
   that none exist for other approaches in case you need to fly a different
   approach
 - they usually (always?) indicate the amendment (eg. "AMDT 6") of the approach
   chart
    - we want to check the amendment number on the approach chart we intend to use,
      if the amendment number (eg. "Amdt 5A") is less than the one mentioned in
      the NOTAM, then the chart has not been updated making the FDC NOTAM relevant
      to us
    - noting this (on the chart or otherwise) suffices to meet our obligation
      of having current charts - of course if there's a newer chart available, then
      using that chart instead is more desirable
 - **if the amendment number is the same as the chart we're using** (it may also
   be in the format "Orig-X" .. not sure what that's about), then it means the
   NOTAM may be temporary and doesn't justify a new issuance of an approach chart

# Other Types of NOTAMs

There are two types of NOTAMS you should be familiar with: **FDC NOTAMs**, and
**NOTAM D**.

**D NOTAMs** - (Distant and Local) NOTAMs contain information that directly
affect your ability to fly an airplane safely. It includes information about

  - airport or runway closures
  - changs in status of navaids
  - radar service availability
  - other information essential to planned enroute, terminal, or landing ops
  - they also contain less critical (but still important) information about
    taxiway closures, personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and
    airport lighting aids such as VASIs
 - D NOTAMS begin with keywords that explain what the NOTAM is for. There's a
   good list of what they are and what they mean in the textbook. For completeness:
    - RWY - Runway
    - TWY - Taxiway
    - APRON - Apron
    - AD - Aerodrome (eg. airport closure)
    - OBST - Obstruction
    - NAV - Navaids
    - COM - Communications
    - SVC - Services (eg. temporary tower operation)
    - AIRSPACE - Airspace (eg. Restricted Area operation is active)
    - (U) - Unverified Aeronautical Information (eg. abandoned vehicle on RWY)
    - (O) - Other Aeronautical Information (eg. controlled burn of house off RWY end)

 **FDC NOTAMs**

  - FDC NOTAMs are regulatory in nature, for example they may be an amendment
    to an IAP, or issuance of a TFR
  - FDC NOTAMs are issued once and kept on file at the FSS until published or
    canceled

All this information is kept in a computer in Kansas City, and distributed
automatically via several sources, such as the FSS, or DUATS.

When you *call* for a flight briefing, make sure you specifically ask for FDC
NOTAMs if you don't get them - you usually will but it's good to be sure.

**GPS NOTAMs**

 - will also be advised by calling FSS or briefing with DUATS
 - consist of satellite outages that prevent you from having sufficient RAIM
   coverage at your destination ETA to legally fly the approach

# Selecting an Alternate Airport

 - recall the 1-2-3 rule for whether you have to file an alternate: if, 1 hour
   before or after your ETA, ceilings are less than 2,000' or visibility is less
   than 3SM, then you legally have to file an alternate
 - let's assume you *do* have to file an alternate...
 - once you've nominated an airport as an alternate, you want to check the approach
   chart to see if that airport has non-standard alternate minimums, or if the
   airport is even available to be listed as an alternate
 - recall that non-standard alternate minimums exist when there's a black triangle
   containing a white 'A' in the briefing strip
    - to find out what the non-standard alternate minimums *are*, we need to look
      at **Section E of the NACO booklet**

# Alternate Not Authorized

 - if an airport can't be used as an alternate, then **the letters 'NA' will be
   written next to the black alternate minimums icon** in the briefing strip
 - it's possible that a different approach could be used, or there may be
   none at that airport without this restriction
 - often the reason for this is because there's no weather reporting system at
   that airport, when you need to determine whether you can land with bad weather
   and potentially low fuel
 - the main idea is to **be careful not to assume that just becase an IAP exists
   at an airport that this airport is legal to use as an alternate**
 - *however* - if you are listing the airport as a *VFR alternate*, then it's still
   legal to use this airport (as long as you don't want to use the IAP) - see
   below for more information

**What if there's no alternate available?**

 - if there's no viable alternate within range (remember: fuel to fly to the
   alternate + 45 mins at normal cruising speed), you either have to cancel or
   wait for VFR conditions

**Alternates *without* any IAPs**

 - you can file an alternate that doesn't have an IAP, **as long as you can
   descend from the airway MEA and land in VFR conditions**
 - to evaluate this:
    - look at the MEA on the nearest airway
    - look at the Area Forecast and assess what the weather is likely to be
      doing at the time of arrival at the alternate
    - if there's a TAF available, you should also check this for more detailed
      information
    - evaluate whether you can maintain VFR minimums based on these forecasts
      while descending from the airway and landing
 - something to keep in mind is that the MEA is used only for *evaluating* whether
   the airport can be filed as an alternate
    - example: if you needed to descend from an airway with an MEA of 5,000', but
      a MOCA of 4,100':
    - if you got to 5,000' and were still in the clouds, but there's a PIREP saying
      the cloud bases are at 4,600', then you can descend (as long as ATC allows
      it) below the MEA to the MOCA, as long as you're either a) within 22NM of the
      VOR (if using it to track the airway), or are using GPS to track the airway
    - if you descend below 4,600' and find yourself in VFR then you're free to
      continue down and land in VFR - remember the MEA was only for *planning*

**Using Non-WAAS GPS Approaches at Alternates**

 - when using *non-WAAS* GPS for nav and instrument approaches, **any required
   alternate airport you choose for your flight plan must have ann approved,
   operational IAP *other* than the GPS**
 - Why? The GPS is subject to a few more errors than other guidance equipment
 - recall our discussion on RAIM, having enough satellites at the alternate, etc.
 - given that the alternate is likely your last chance of getting down, the FAA
   wants you to have a pretty good chance of getting on the ground
 - this **doesn't apply to an IFR certified WAAS GPS** since it's certified as a
   'sole source' nav device

# Filing the Flight Plan

**Commonly Used Equipment Suffixes**

 - **Transponder**
    - /X - no transponder
    - /T - transponder with no Mode C
    - /U - transponder with Mode C
 - **DME**
    - /D - no transponder
    - /B - transponder with no Mode C
    - /A - transponder with Mode C
 - **Area Navigation (RNAV)**
    - /Y - RNAV (no GNSS [ie. no GPS]) with no transponder
    - /C - RNAV (no GNSS [ie. no GPS]) with transponder and no Mode C
    - /I - RNAV (no GNSS [ie. no GPS]) with transponder and Mode C
    - /V - GNSS (ie. GPS) with no transponder
    - /S - GNSS (ie. GPS) with transponder and no Mode C
    - /G - GNSS (ie. GPS) with transponder and with Mode C

# Composite Flight Plans

*Note: it seems this might be out of date. The practise test I've taken say to
just check both IFR and VFR boxes when filing the flight plan, not filing two
separate flight plans. Need to verify this.*

 - when you file a composite VFR/IFR flight plan, the FSS specialist actually fills
   out two separate flight plans for you
 - if we wanted to fly VFR for the start of the flight and then switch to IFR...
    - you'd file the VFR from the departure point to a navaid or fix enroute
    - then file the IFR flight plan from that fix to the destination
 - while flying you'd pick up the VFR flight plan
 - when reaching the fix/navaid/intersection, you'd **cancel the VFR flight plan**,
   and activate the IFR flight plan - the person opening the IFR flight plan
   has no information that you were on a VFR flight plan, so you want to make
   sure they don't send Search and Rescue out for you
 - of course, you may want to avoid filing the VFR flight plan all together
    - in this case, you'd just file your IFR flight plan from the intersection
      where you want to pick it up, and then pick up the IFR clearance in the air
 - this system also works in reverse, you can file IFR for your departure (eg.
   if the weather at the departure airport is bad but the rest is good) and then
   VFR for the rest of the route
 - an IFR flight plan departure can also be useful for departing complex airspace,
   such as near a Class B - then you don't have to worry about routing or violations,
   and just worry about flying the route on the departure

# VFR-On-Top

 - another option to consider is the VFR-On-Top clearance
 - this allows you to remain on your IFR flight plan while fljying in VFR conditions
   above, below, or between cloud layers as long as you maintain VFR minimums
 - for example, if you're in hard IMC at 6,000' with a freezing level of 5,000',
   and know the tops are at 7,000', you may want to climb to 8,000' to get out
   of the IMC
 - supposed the controller clears you to climb to VFR conditions on top and
   report reaching VFR
    - you'd begin your climb above the clouds to an appropriate VFR altitude
      for the direction of flight, and maintaining cloud clearance (eg. 1,000'
      above)
 - if you're operating VFR-on-top, **you must also follow see and avoid procedures,
   and adhere to all IFR flight rules applicable to the flight (eg. MEAs, MRAs, etc.)
    - in other words, *both* VFR and IFR rules apply
    - you must still make all required position reports and adhere to all IFR
      clearances - the only thing that changed is you're flying at a VFR altitude
 - while you can obtain this clearance enroute, you can **also file for it**
    - in this case you would include "OTP/<altitude>" for the altitude in the
      flight plan, eg. "OTP/125" means a "climb to VFR conditions on top at
      12,500' is requested"
    - the actual clearance might be something like "2132 Bravo, climb and maintain
      VFR conditions on top. If not on top by (altitude), maintain (altitude) and
      advise."
 - finally, **VFR on top isn't allowed in Class A airspace** (where you can't fly
   without an Instrment Flight Plan anyway)

# Obtaining your IFR Clearance

 - ATC will keep your flight plan on file for at least 1 hour after your proposed
   departure time, if you're running late call the FSS and give a new departure time
 - before starting your engine at busy towered airports, listen to ATIS - they may
   instruct you to get your clearance from Clearance Delivery
 - otherwise, obtain your clearance from Ground Control before starting your
   engine
 - **some airports have pre-taxi clearance procedures** - when this is available
   it's recommended you call no more than 10 minutes before the proposed departure
   time. If pre-taxi clearance exists, a frequency will be listed in the Chart
   Supplement
 - the clearance includes:
    - **Clearance Limit:** airport, navaid, intersection etc.
    - **Route:** including the SID if issued
    - **Altitude**
    - **Frequency:** frequency to contact Departure Control on
    - **Transponder Code**
 - when copying the clearance, don't worry about analyzing it - just get it down
   on paper
 - note that you're not *legally required* to read back the clearance, but it's
   definitely a good idea
