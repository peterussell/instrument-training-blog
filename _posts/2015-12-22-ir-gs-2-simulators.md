Just a quick one tonight, it was an early morning after a late night studying yesterday and I'm
feeling a bit pooped.

This section's on the different types of simulators and how they can be used during instrument training.

# Types of simulators
There are two types of simulators that can be used to log time towards the 40 hours of required instrument flight time, and one that can't:

 - **Flight Training Device (FTD)**: more advanced than ATDs, no certified motion (only 'simulators' have certified motion). You can log up to 20 hours toward instrument flight time in these.
 - **Aviation Training Device (ATD)**: further broken down into Advanced and Basic:
   - Advanced ATD (AATD): more sophisticated than a BATD. Can log up to 20 hours.
   - Basic ATD (BATD): less sophisicated than an AATD. Can log up to 10 hours.


 - **Personal Computer Assisted Training Device (PCATD)**: these are home sims like Microsoft Flight Sim or P3D. They can't be used to log instrument time (even with an instructor).

# Logging Simulator Time
To log simulator time toward the 40 hours of instrument flight time, you must be receiving dual instruction from an authorized instructor (presumably a CFII?)
