# Thunderstorms

 - thunderstorms include three ingredients: **moisture**, **unstable air**, and a **lifting force**
    - moisture is a necessary ingredient of thunderstorms because it contains trapped energy in
      the form of latent heat, the more moisture in the air, the more the thunderstorm can grow
    - the unstable air allows the cumulus cloud to build and heat up well beyond the temperature of
      their surroundings, *stable* air acts like a lid on the cumulus' vertical growth
    - the lifting force, such as wind blowing up a mountain, a frontal lifting force, surface
      heating, or convective activity is often sufficient to start thunderstorm formation

# Thunderstorm Lifecycle

 - thunderstorm lifecycles generally range from **20 to 90 minutes**
 - they usually form in clusters of 2 or more cells
 - they have three stages, *cumulus*, *mature*, and *dissipating*

**Cumulus Stage**

 - although cumulus clouds don't always become thunderstorms, the beginning stage of a thunderstorm
   is always a cumulus cloud
  - air parcels, given a shove upward by a lifting force, form a small cumulus cloud
  - as the cumulus cloud grows, updrafts draw in more moist air from below
  - latent heat is released as the moisture condenses, which increases the temperature and
    accelerates its growth
  - the **cumulus stage is characterized by updrafts that can exceed 3,000 FPM**

**Mature Stage**

 - thunderstorms are nastiest during the mature stage
 - characterized by **updrafts**, **downdrafts**, **turbulence** (sometimes severe), **low level wind
   shear**, **hail**, **ice**, **rain**, and **lightning**
 - near the end of the *cumulus* stage (just before the mature stage) there's a lot of water in the cloud
 - the cloud droplets are very close together and give the cloud its crisp, well defined appearance
 - as more low-level, moisture-laden air is drawn into the cloud, the condensation process continues,
   producing additional droplets in the updrafts
    - in other words, the *rate* of precipitation growth is *increased* where air currents carry droplets
      upward and increase the *size* of those droplets
 - the cloud droplets begin **bumping into each other and forming larger droplets**
 - at this point, the only thing holding these droplets aloft is the updraft
    - as long as they're not too heavy, they're held aloft - **the stronger the updrafts the bigger the
      raindrops**
 - once they can't be held any longer they fall from the cloud, but *still combining* with droplets on
   the way down
 - the **first sign that the thunderstorm has reached the mature stage is rain at the surface**
 - falling water creates downdrafts, because the rain drops drag air down with them
    - the greater the rainfall rate, the greater the downdrafts
 - with updrafts and downdrafts, the mature stage is the most turbulent, etc.
 - you can expect hail at any time during this stage
 - it's common for thunderstorms to grow from 25,000' - 35,000', and in some places can grown to 50,000'
   to 60,000'

**Dissipating Stage**

 - throughout the mature stage, downdrafts grow and updrafts weaken - ultimately **downdrafts** are all
   that are left
 - the dissipating stage is often **characterized by an anvil top**
    - without further vertical development, the top of the cumulus cloud is blown over by high-altitude
      winds
    - the anvil will point in the direction that the thunderstorm is moving, which gives a good indication
      of which side of the thunderstorm you *don't* want to be on
 - these same winds disassemble the cloud's structure
    - the cloud's water is now almost gone and is instead composed mostly of ice crystals
    - the crisp, sharp edges in the mature stage now look soft and fuzzy
    - rain at the surface is much lighter now

# Thunderstorm Types

The lifting action required for thunderstorm formation can be from any of four sources: a front, air movingA
up a mountain, heating from below (creating convective currents), or convergence of air.

Typically thunderstorms form in air masses, in fronts, or over mountains.

**Air Mass Thunderstorms**

 - generally form in a warm, moist air mass and are *not associated with a front*
 - they're generally classified as **convective** (heated from below) or **orographic** (mountain-
   induced)
 - usually **isolated and widely scattered** enough that you can navigate around them
 - **the most important characteristics of an air mass thunderstorm:**
    - they move very slowly, making them relatively easy to avoid
    - they're very hard to forecast
 - can sometimes be formed by rising air in a low pressure trough

**Orographic Thunderstorms**

 - occur when moist, unstable air is forced up mountain slopes
 - when heating from below works in conjuction with other lifting forces *orographic lifting, for example)
   airmass thunderstorms tend to increase in frequency, especially during afternoon and early evening
 - sometimes thunderstorms are scattereda long mountain peaks and safe passage around them is possible
 - when conditions are right, however, entire mountain ranges can be obscured by orographic thunderstorms
    - these can prevent passage for substantial distances in mountain ranges like the Rockies

**Frontal Thunderstorms**

 - thunderstorms along fronts vary in intensity because the fronts vary in slope and speed - fast moving
   fronts typically produce the nastiest thunderstorms
 - thunderstorms found in **cold fronts** are normally the worst, except for those found in **squall lines**
 - **frontal thunderstorms normally form in continuous lines**, making circumnavigation impractical
 - thunderstorms can also be found in **warm fronts**
    - the gentleness of warm frontal lifting produces stratiform type clouds
    - these clouds can *hide* thunderstorms, called **embedded thunderstorms**
    - however, thunderstorms associated with warm fronts are usually the least severe of all frontal-type
      thunderstorms (but you still shouldn't fly through them, or through stratiform clouds possibly
      containing thunderstorms)
 - **warm occlusions** can also produce thunderstorms
    - rapid lifting of warm air occurs along the upper cold front which sets off thunderstorm development
    - these are usually more severe than thunderstorms in warm fronts
    - they can also be embedded thunderstorms in stratiform clouds

# Squall Lines

 - squall lines are associated wit hthe most severe weather conditions - large hail, destructive winds,
   tornadoes
 - squall lines often develop up to 180 miles ahead of and roughly parallel to a **fast-moving cold front**
 - cold fronts are most often associated with squall lines, but aren't required
    - they can also be formed by low pressure troughs, easterly waves, or atmospheric convergence

**Difference between a Squall Line and a Squall**

 - a **squall** is defined as a **sudden increase in wind speed of at least 16 knots**, with the speed
   rising to 22 knots or more for at least one minute

# Thunderstorm Turbulence

 - **if you accidentally enter a thunderstorm** the FAA recommends:
    - fly straight ahead
    - reduce speed for the recommened turbulence penetration speed (probably below Va)
    - maintain a level **attitude** - don't try and compensate for the up and down drafts as you might
      overstress the airframe

**First Gust**

 - first gust is one of the biggest hazards produced by a thunderstorm
 - during the mature stage, when rain begins falling from beneath the cell, a massive gust of cold air
   shoots down to ground level and spreads out in a horizontal direction
    - winds of 20 to 50 knots or higher, within 150' of the ground, have been reported
    - winds are most intense 10 to 15 miles from the storm, but have been reported up to 50 miles from
      the generating cell
 - the passage of a gust resembles a mini cold front - as it passes the wind shifts and becomes strong
   and gusty, the temperature drops sharply, and surface pressure rises
    - this cold air can lingers close to the ground for several hours after the thunderstorm dissipates
 - **visual clues**: the first sign of rain under a thunderstorm cell, rising dust, flailing trees
 - you want to **think very carefully about taking off or landing in the presence of a thunderstorm**

# Virga

 - Virga stands for "Variable Intensity Rain Graident Aloft", it contains virgin rain
 - the rain is called *virgin rain* because it **doesn't reach the ground**
    - rain falls from a cumulus cloud (usually altocumulus) and *evaporates* before reaching the surface

**How it Works**

 - given that the rain evaporates before reaching the ground, and we know that it takes heat to
   evaporate water, where does the heat come from?
    - it comes from the air the rain falls through
    - this makes the air cold
    - the cold air descends, pickin up speed as it descends
    - therefore you can expect moderate turbulence and high speed downdrafts below virga
 - the of downdrafts below virga is generally much smaller than a thunderstorm, usually about **2 1/2 miles**
 - you definitely want to avoid flying directly underneath and near virga

# Thunderstorm Avoidance

 - when flying *near* or *around* thunderstorm cells, **avoid each one by at least 20 miles**
 - therefore, if flying between two cells you want a distance of at least 40 miles between them
 - avoid flying directly under a thunderstorm cell, remember the strong downdrafts during the
   mature stage (and to some extent the dissipating stage)

**Thunderstorm Avoidance In IMC**

 - there are only really two practical ways to do this:
    1. **lightning detection equipment** (Stormscope, Strike Finder, etc.)
    2. **airborne radar** (you can use the controller's radar, but there are definite limits on
       what these can tell you)
 - otherwise, you can visually avoid thunderstorms if you're in VMC and able to see them, or
   lightning strikes at night (but this is less than ideal because it only works when there's
   lightning)

# Lightning

 - lightning is a phenomenon associated *with every thunderstorm* (without lightning you'd have no thunder)
 - the most important thing to understand is it seldom affects airplanes in flight
 - however, at night, be aware that it could upset your adjusted eyes due to the big flash of light
    - if you expect future unavoidable flashes, it's often best to turn the cockpit lights up as bright
      as possible, simply to get the eyes used to an elevated level of intensity

**Lightning Formation**

 - one theory is that while drops bump against each other in the cloud, this causes charges to move
   around inside the cloud
 - the **earth is positively charged**
    - the theory is that the negatively charged cloud particles collect at the bottom of the cloud, and
      when the charge is great enough they try to discharge to the earth, creating a lightning strike

# Microbursts

 - a microburst is a very small scale but very intense downdraft of air that spreads outwards from its center
   in all directions when reaching the surface
 - the wind shear produces both vertical and horizontal components, and hazards are greater at lower altitudes
 - the big problem is they're **very hard to predict, see, or detect**
    - this is due to the small size, short lifespan, and that it can occur in areas without surface
      precipitation
 - good indicators are middle or low layer convective cloud types, or within the heavy rain portion (mature)
   of a thunderstorm, or where there's virga
 - **characteristics:**
    - **size:** typically less than 1 mile in diameter as it descends from the cloud base to 1,000'-3,000'
      above the ground
    - near the ground the horizontal outflow can increase to 2 1/2 miles in diameter
    - **intensity:** downdrafts can be as strong as 6,000 FPM, horizontal surface winds as strong as
      45 knots, resulting in a 90 knot wind shear (headwind to tailwind for traversing aircraft)
    - **visual signs:** can be found almost anywhere there's convective activity, may be embedded in heavy
      rain associated with a thunderstorm, or in light trainng in virga. WHere there's little or no
      precipitation at the surface, a ring of blowing dust may be the only visual clue
    - **duration:** seldom longer than 15 minutes from striking the ground to dissipation. Horizontal winds
      continue to increase during the first 5 minutes, maximum intensity lasting approximately 2-4 minutes,
    - **once a microburst occurs, multiple microbursts in the same general area are not uncommon**

# Turbulence and Wind Shear

 - **wind shear occurs** when wind makes a **rapid change in direction, velocity, or both**
 - wind shear can become a factor during landing, when winds flow over uneven terrain
    - like water, wind is upset, tumbles and churns, as it flows over buildings, trees, etc.
 - wind shear is hardly felt as more than a bump in low-wind conditions
 - however, given enough wind speed (10 - 15 knots+), the turbulence can be quite noticeable
 - in these conditions, it's a good idea to increase the approach speed by a few knots for better
   controllability during landing
 - **convective currents** are the most common form of turbulence you're likely to encounter in flight
    - these can be caused by uneven heating of the surface, eg. asphalt, water, wheat field, trees, sand
    - when going over differen types of surface you may expect convective turbulence, especially
      on a hot day
