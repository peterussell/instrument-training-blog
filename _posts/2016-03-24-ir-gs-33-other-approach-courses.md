There are three other types of electronic approach courses taht you might encounter as an instrument pilot. Although they're less commonly used, it's worth knowing something about them.

# Simplified Directional Facility (SDF)

 - used where local obstructions make a normal ILS or localizer installation impossible
 - an SDF course may or may not be aligned with the runway
 - the course may be wider than a localizer (it's either 6 or 12 degrees wide), resulting in less lateral precision
 - the reason for the wider angle is to provide better course guidance and flyability based on obstructions present along the approach
 - the antenna may also be offsetto provide the minimum number of obstructions along the approach
 - the angle of convergence between the final approach course and the runway bearing should be determined by reference to the instrument approach chart, *the angle offset is not normally more than 3 degrees*
 - you **should note this angle**, since the approach course originates at the antenna site, and an approach beyond the threshold would lead to the SDF offset position rather than the runway centerline
 - usable off-course indications are limited to 35 degrees either side of the course centerline
   - instrument indications in the area between 35 and 90 degrees from the course centerline are not controlled and should be ignored
 - an SDF identifier is three letters (with *no* leading 'I' like the localizer has)
   - for example,, the identifier for Fond du Lac SDF is 'FLD'

# Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA)

 - the LDA is a secondhand localizer signal - sometimes, the localizer for one airport hapeens to pass over or near the vicinty of another airport
 - since the FAA's big on sharing, it often lets the second airport use the same localizer
   - *for example, Van Nuys uses the localizer at Burbank for its approach
 - the LDA is comparable in utility and accuracy to a localizer (since it *is* a localizer), but is not part of a complete ILS
 - the LDA course width is between 3 and 6 degrees, more precise than an SDF installation
 - some LDAs *are* equipped with a glideslope, but (as in the case of VNY) may not be aligned with the runway
   - straight-in landing minimums may be published where the angle between the runway centerline and LDA course doesn't exceed 30 degrees
   - if the angle exceeds 30 degrees, only circling minimums are published (more on these later)
 - the identifier is three letters preceeded by 'I', transmitted in code on the LDA frequency
   - for example, the identifier for Van Nuys LDA is "I-BUR"

# Microwave Landing System

 - appears to be so rare it's not even covered in the textbook
