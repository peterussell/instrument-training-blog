# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)

 - values are in Feet Per Minute (FPM)
 - needle swings up to show an increase in rate of climb, downward to show an increase in rate of descent
 - useful for catching trends away from an established pitch attitude (responds faster than the altimeter)

# How the VSI works
 - uses only the static port
 - made up of an expandable capsule contained within another chamber inside the VSI's housing (like an altimeter)
 - capsule is connected to the static port via a **normal size tube**
 - housing is connected to the static port via a **capilliary tube** (also called an **airflow restrictor**)

 - at a **constant** altitude the pressure in the capsule and housing are the same, VSI reads 0 FPM
 - during **climb**, pressure in the capsule increases quickly, but pressure in the housing only catches up slowly, which registers as a climb on the VSI
 - during a **descent**, pressure in the capsule decreases quickly, pressure in the housing catches up slowly, registers as a descent on the VSI

# VSI Errors (can you fly IFR?)
 - VSI errors can be observed on the ground, eg. if it reads +100FPM while sitting on the ground
 - OK to fly IFR, the VSI is **not a required instrument**
 - take a mental note of the deviance and include that in your mental calculations

**However! (important)**

ATC expects you to report any inability to climb or descend at 500FPM to an assigned altitude when within 1,000' of that altitude.
