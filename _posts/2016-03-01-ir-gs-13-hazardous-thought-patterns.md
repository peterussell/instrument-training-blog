A pilot's attitude is different to their personality. Some attitudes have been categorized and identified as particularly 'hazardous'. Fortunately they can be fixed, using the related 'antidote'.

There are three steps to identifying a hazardous attitude and rectifying it:

 1. Recognize a thought as one of the five hazardous attitudes
 2. Label the thought as the specific attitude
 3. State and apply the antidote

# The Five Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes

 1. **Anti-Authority**
   - an attitude where rules aren't followed, and often deliberately broken, like buzzing houses, ignoring ATC instructions
   - **Attitude**: "don't tell me what to do"
   - **Antidote**: "follow the rules, they are usually right"

 2. **Impulsivity**
   - the desire to do something immediately, even if it may not be the right thing to do
   - **Attitude**: "do something quickly"
   - **Antidote**: "not so fast, think first"

 3. **Invulnerability**
   - the feeling someone has that an accident won't happen to them. They're aware of them and know the consequences, but don't believe it will ever be them on the receiving end
   - **Attitude**: "it won't happen to me"
   - **Antidote**: "it could happen to me"

 4. **Macho**
   - a desire a pilot might have to prove they have no fear, concern, or hesitation, which can lead to taking risks to impress others
   - **Attitude**: "I can do it"
   - **Antidote**: "taking chances is foolish"

 5. **Resignation**
   - an attitude where a person just kind of 'drifts along', rather than seeking useful information and makes good decisions based on that information
   - **Attitude**: "what's the use?"
   - **Antidote**: "I'm not useless, I can make a difference"
