Because VOR navigation is so important, [FAR 91.171][far-171] requires you to ensure that your VOR equipment is operating properly before using it under IFR.

To legally fly IFR, your VOR equipment must have a ***logged* accuracy check within the preceding 30 days**.

 - you must log your signature, place of the VOR test, the error shown by the test, and the date.
 - think of **SPED**: **S**ignature, **P**lace, **A**ccuracy, and **D**ate
 - it can be done on any record sufficient to prove that the equipment was legal for use

There are five ways to test your VOR for accuracy:

 1. **Using a VOT**
   - a VOR or *"VOR Test"* signal is a signal transmitted from a nearby VOT test facility
   - VOR receiver checkpoints are in the rear of the A/FD
   - this facility **radiates a 360 radial in all directions**
   - by tuning the VOT frequency in your nav radio, you should hear a series of dots or continuous tone
   - next, **rotate the OBS to 180 - you should get a centered needle with a 'TO' indication**. If it doesn't, center the needle and note the bearing under the course selector.
   - **then, rotate the OBS to 0/360 should center the needle with a FROM flag**. If it doesn't, center the needle and note the bearing under the course selector.
   - **the allowable deviation is +/- 4 degrees**
   - a good memory aid is to think of doing the test in a **Cessna 182** (for 180 with a TO flag)
   - VOT checks can be done either on the ground or in the air, but only when the A/FD specifically approves it (if Ground only, the A/FD shows 'G' under the 'Type, VOT Facility' column
 2. **Using a certified Airborne test signal / 3. Using a certified Ground test signal**
   - these are also specified in the back of the A/FD
   - it shows the airport, frequency & identifier for the test facility, whether it can be on the ground or in the air, the course to set, the distance from the facility, and the location at the airport or in the air the check should be done.
   - *Example: Chico (Facility Name) / 109.8/CIC (Freq/Ident) / G (Type of Check) / 302 ('Azimuth from Facility') (OBS value) / 1.1 (Dist. from Facility) / On north runup area (Check Point Descriptor)*
   - they can also be airborne, in which case the Type of Check will be 'A' and show the altitude the check must be done at, combined with the location under Check Point Descriptor
   - **Tolerances:** Ground: +/- 4 degrees, Air: +/- 6 degrees

 4. **Cross-checking one VOR receiver against another in the same airplane**
   - *requires two sets of nav equipment*
   - tune both VORs to the same station, ID the station
   - center the needle on both
   - check the course bearing selections against each other
   - **Tolerances:** they must be within 4 degrees of each other

 5. **Creating your own airborne checkpoint**
   - select a VOR radial lying along the centerline of an established airway
   - select a prominent ground point along that radial **more than 20 NM** from the station
   - maneuver over the point at a reasonably low altitude
   - note the VOR bearing indicated by the receiver
   - **Tolerances:** +/- 6 degrees

**Tolerances:** essentially, on the ground tolerances are 4 degrees, in the air they're 6 degrees

Finally, if there's a tolerable error noted (eg. under +/- 4 degrees or +/- 6 degrees) **don't try and compensate for it while flying**, some pilots have tried to and got the math wrong.
