# Atmospheric Circulation

 - all weather is the result of the uneven heating of the earth's surface
 - air that circulates brings with it some of the general properties of the surface
   over which it's formed, eg. hot/cold/wet/dry, which means water can be transported
   by moving air

We'll consider a basic example that doesn't take into account the earth rotating or any
heating or cooling of the earth's surface due to anything but equatorial heat. That said...

 - air over the equator is heated, becomes less dense, and rises
    - as the air rises it cools, until reaching air of a similar temperature
    - this air is *near the **tropopause***
 - once the air temperature reaches equilibrium it stops rising, but doesn't
   stop moving
 - unable to ascend any further, it moves north and south toward the poles, where it
   eventually cools and descends
 - the cycle is completed when cold, descending polar air moves toward the equator,
   replacing the rising equatorial air

# The Coriolis Force

 - when viewed from above the north pole, the **counter-clockwise rotation** of the earth
   causes air to curve or twist...
    - to its **right** in the **northern hemisphere**
    - **left**, as seen from the south pole, in the **southern hemisphere**
 - air is forced to curve by the coriolis force, which is an **apparent force**, meaning
   no energy is expended in the making of this force

*The earth rotates (counter-clockwise from the north pole)  under a moving parcel of air,
which gives the air the appearance of being deflected to the **right** of the direction
in which it was moving.

When observing a single parcel of air:

 - in the north hemisphere, rising warm air at the equator is deflected to the right in an
   **easterly** direction by the Coriolis force
 - eventually the high altitude rising air moves in an easterly direction and starts to
   bunch up
    - this occurs most noticeably at **about 30 degrees N latitude**
 - as the air rises, some heat is lost through radiation through the ascent
 - both bunching up and cooling cause some (not all) of this air to descend slowly at the
   30 degree N latitude
 - bunching up cases a **higher surface pressure at the 30 degree N latitude** position
 - as the air descends toward the surface, it warms, causing clear skies (usually) and
   warm surface temperatures
    - some of this descending higher pressure air flows southward toward lower pressure
      at the equator
    - the *rest* of this warm, low altitude air moves northward
 - some of the high altitude air that didn't descend at 30 degrees N latitude continues
   on toward the north pole
    - as it continues to cool, it falls, and travels south from the North Pole
    - at approximately **60 degrees N latitude** the south-moving cold air meets the
      north-moving warmer air
    - these two air masses have different temperatures, and therefore different densities
 - when **cold polar air bumps into cool tropical air**, the result is a transition zone,
   known as the **polar front**
    - **Polar Front:** simply a zone where air masses with different densities meet
 - the north-moving cool air moves *up, over* the south moving polar (colder) air
    - the ascending air is carried northward, toward the pole, with the rest of the
      high-altitude winds

**Summary**

Now have three separate cells, with three separate wind patterns:

 - 0N to 30N: rises from equator, flows north, some descends at 30N
    - surface winds: **Northeast Trade Winds** (coming from the NE, going SW)
 - 30N to 60N: some descending air from 30N goes further north, and rises at 60N
    - surface winds: **Prevailing Westerlies** (come from SW, going to the NE)
 - 60N to 180N: air is flowing *from* the pole back to the equator, the polar front is at 60N
    - surface winds: **Polar Easterlies** (coming from NE, going SW)

Each of these three cells is affected by the coriolis force (deflected to the *right*
in the northern hemisphere).

At **high altitudes**, the winds are always going from the equator toward the pole. At
**low altitudes** the surface winds are going:

 - toward the equator at 0 - 30N
 - toward the pole at 30 - 60N
 - toward the equator at 60 - 180N

# Air Pressure and Vertial Air Movement

Air has weight which exerts a pressure on the earth's surface. Changing the air's temperature
changes its density and the pressure it exerts.

 - warmer = less dense = lower pressure = rising
 - cooler = more dense = higher pressure = falling

As warm air rises, cool air moves in to replace it. Thus, high pressure air moves toward
low pressure air, causing circulation.

# Water in the Air

 - air contains water, which got there one of two ways:
    - **evaporation:** solar heating causes water molecules to absorb heat energy, given enough
      heat the water molecules eventually break free and enter the atmosphere
    - **sublimation:** occurs when a solid (ice or snow) turns directly into a gas, or gas turns
      directly into a solid. When the outside temp is below the freezing point of water, and the
      air is dry enough to begin with, water molecules will pass directly from icebergs, ice
      crystals, or snow, into the atosphere
 - **for a given temperature, the air can only hold a certain amount of water**
 - the air is **saturated** when additional water vapor is unable to enter the air *at a given
   temperature*

**Water Content of Warm and Cold Air**

 - warm air has the capacity to hold more water than colder air (which is why it's more humid
   when it's hot)
 - this occurs because water molecules **like to cling to each other**
 - heating the air causes both air and water molecules to *vibrate faster*
    - molecules that bounce around and ricochet are less likely to stick to each other
    - thus, you can put more water molecules into warmer ear without them forming visible
      moisture (clouds)
 - as the air cools, water molecules move slower, vibrate less, and stick to each other
 - **clinging water molecules become visible** in the form of a cloud
    - in other words, the water molecules can't remain as vapor (gas) so they return to the
      liquid state in the form of something visible (a cloud)
    - additional cooling causes the water droplets to grow in size
 - the process of water vapor becoming visible is called **condensation**

# Ways to Cool Air

There are two ways to cool air:

 1. put it in contact with a cooler surface or environment
 2. lift it and let it cool by expansion

**Cooler Surface/Environment**

 - warm air contains a lot of moisture
 - when it comes into contact with colder surrounds (eg. warm moist breath being let out
   on a cold day) it becomes saturated, condensation occurs, and a cloud (or droplets) form
 - **fog formation** is often based on air coming into contact with a cooler surface

**Lifting Air & Cooling by Expansion**

 - if you lift air, you cool it
 - rising air undergoes a decrease in pressure because of the decrease in weight of the
   atmosphere above/around it - air molecules expand when subject to less pressure
 - since there is no other energy source available, the air molecules must use their
   own energy to expand, which slows them down, which results in a lower temperature
    - **ie. rising air molecules use up their energy to rise, and therefore the molecules
      can't vibrate around as quickly**
 - when the air cools it can't hold as much water, and creates visible moisture (clouds)

# Relative Humidity

 - relative humidity is a measure of how much water vapor the air is holding in relationship
   to how much it could theoretically hold at the current temperature
 - when the air is saturated (can't hold any more moisture), then the relative humidity
   is 100% - something has to happen
 - there are two ways of this happening, either the air keeps sucking up more and more
   moisture, *or* the air is cooled until it's at a temperature where the pre-existing
   amount of moisture can't stay in the air any longer as vapor
    - in other words, **when the temperature of an air parcel *decreases*, the relative
      humidity *increases***

# The Dewpoint

 - the dewpoint is the **temperature to which a parcel of air must be cooled in order to
   reach 100% relative humidity (ie. saturation)**
 - the difference between the current temperature and the dewpoint is called the
   temperature/dewpoint spread
 - **the process of condensation can actually begin about 5 degrees F (2.8 degrees C)
   before the air cools to its dewpoint**
 - dewpoints are handy for instrument pilots: a **high dewpoint** indicates that there's
   a lot of water in the air
    - you can expect something called **mesoscale convective weather** (discussed later) when
      **dewpoints are above 60 degrees F**
 - *example: you're planning an IFR flight to arrive at an airport about a half hour after
   sunset. Low clouds and low visibility already exist at the airport. What is the likelihood
   that visibility will improve after sunset?* Not much - visibility will probably drop
   quickly when the air strats cooling.
