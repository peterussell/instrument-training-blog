# Weather Charts - Big Picture

**NEXRAD**

 - shows areas where the **radar engergy** has reflected off water suspended
   in the air, remember, it *doesn't show cloud coverage*
 - the values on a NEXRAD chart are **radar reflectivity values**
    - they are also referred to as **Z calibrated reflectivity values**
      calibrated in dB, therefore referred to as **dBZ**, or decibels of Z
    - they represent the *amount of water suspended in a cloud*
    - the more water in the cloud, the stronger the vertical air currents
      required to suspend that water
 - **What to avoid**
    - how do you interpret the radar reflectivity values (Z)?
    - you have to look at another chart that may not be immediately available to
      you, called the National Weather Service's *Storm Level index*
    - *airline pilots* always **avoid Level Three (and above)** - the turbulence
      associated with a Level 3 storm is commonly found in thunderstorms
    - *think: **th**ree = **th**understorm
    - whenever possible, airline pilots also avoid stand-alone areas of Level 2
      returns, because they contain rain and often make for a rough and noisy
      ride
    - **Level 3 returns** begin at 40 dBZ and above
    - on an airline pilot's radar screen, they are **red** - unfortunately NEXRAD
      **has no standardization for color-coding**
    - keep in mind that the *highest level of turbulence associated with the
      present storm activity in any cloud is assumed to apply statistically
      throughout the entire mass of clouds containing that storm
    - seeing one small 40 dBZ return in a large area of continuous lesser returns
      still mean that 40 dBZ will be applied to that entire larger area

**Base vs. Composite Reflective Imagery**

Sometimes you have a choice of which kind of NEXRAD return you want to view,
specifically, it's usually a choice between **Base Reflectivity**, and
**Composite Reflectivity**.

 - **Base Reflectivity** only shows the reflected energy **at a single elevation
   scan** of the radar (typically at a lower tilt of the radar antenna)
    - this can be done for either a short range (approx 124 NM) or long range
      (248 NM)
 - **Composite Reflectivity** display the highest reflectivity from all elevations
   within the radar antenna's vertical scan range

Therefore *the base reflectivity image may not reveal the water content in upper
portions of the cloud*. As a pilot, it's **the total water content of a cloud
that's important to you**, because that value represents the potential turbulence
within a cloud. That's why the **composite reflectivity images are usually more
meaningful** when trying to understand the turbulence potential of a storm.

# Surface Analysis Chart

 - now that we've checked the NEXRAD chart, we want to take the areas of radar
   reflectivity returns and identify which direction they're moving in and how
   fast, to determine whether they're likely to affect our flight
 - these give locations of fronts, and areas of high or low pressure
 - we can use those to determine how the radar reflectivity areas might move;
   recall that...
    - low pressure moves up and counterclockwise ('unscrews' like a lid)
    - high pressure moves down clockwise ('screws down' like a lid)
 - for example: if we have a low pressure area with a high radar return sitting
   on the north-west edge of it, then we can expect that radar return area to
   move counter-clockwise, in a south-west then south-east direction

# 12 and 24-hour Prognostic Charts

 - we can further confirm the observations shown in the surface analysis chart
   by looking at the weather trends on the 12 and 24-hour prognostic charts
 - if these prog charts match up with our suspicions then that's a good indication
   of where the high/low pressure areas are moving and how fast

# Severe Weather Outlook Chart

 - we'll examine these charts further in the weather chapters
 - the key idea presented here is that the Severe Weather Outlook chart (24 hours)
   can show 'non-severe' weather forecast, but that *doesn't* rule out the chance
   that there could be thunderstorms, just that they aren't the types that spawn
   tornadoes or large hailstones, **that doesn't mean you should fly through them**

# Significant Low-Level WX Prognostic Chart

 - again, we'll cover this in detail later
 - shows turbulence (dashed line), marginal VFR/IFR conditions (scalloped
   lines), and freezing levels (green dashed lines)
    - these are often associated with numbers showing the bottoms/tops of the
      forecast phenomena
    - for freezing levels, you can interpolate a slope between different freezing
      level numbers - keep in mind that if there's a large amount of moisture
      present along the route, then you need to be *really careful* about freezing
      levels
    - **icing is possible where freezing or below, and visible moisture is present**
    - this doesn't mean icing *will* occur, but should definitely be avoided
    - keep in mind that it's **illegal to fly into known icing conditions in an
      airplane not certified for that kind of operation**
