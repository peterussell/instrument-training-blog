# Weather Briefing Overview

Getting an IFR weather briefing is similar to a VFR briefing, except that the information
you receive is often much more extensive. While briefers realize that VFR pilots need to
avoid bad weather, IFR pilots are assumed to be prepared to tackle the bad stuff.

Briefings are available in the same ways as for VFR:

 - FSS (1-800 WX-BRIEF)
 - DUATS
 - other packages, aviationweather.gov/ADDS (Aviation Digital Data Service)
    - as far as I can tell the difference between the AWC and ADDS is that ADDS provides the charts

*Note: the text talks about an 'Official Weather Briefing'. In actual fact this just refers
to the fact that the briefing is recorded in order to provide proof that you received it, and
satistfied FAR [FAR 91.103][far-91-103]. In the case of **Foreflight** this weather briefing is
both a) based on official weather sources (NWS/NOAA), and the fact that you received the
briefing is recorded for 120 days (if you tapped the 'Briefing' button). More information on
[Foreflight Weather][foreflight-wx].*

# Types of Briefings

**Standard Briefing**

A standard briefing is the most comprehensive briefing for current weather. It contains:

 - all the important weather items of concern
    - adverse conditions
    - weather synopsis
    - current weather
    - forecast weather
    - forecast winds aloft
    - alternate routes if any
 - NOTAMS, including items concerning
    - airports
    - navaids
    - other hazards

**Abbreviated Briefing**

Ask for an *abbreviated briefing* if calling to update or supplement a previously acquired
briefing, and **state the specific information you need**. Each type of information has its
own rate of change, eg. METARs change hourly while TAFs change every 6 hours.

**Outlook Briefing**

Ask for an *outlook briefing* if you're calling about a flight **six hours or more in advance
of your proposed departure time.**  For example, if you're calling the night before a flight,
you'd ask for an outlook briefing.

An outlook briefing gives general information to give you a notion of what's out there, and
whether the weather is so bad (or good) that you should definitely cancel (or plan) your flight.

A standard briefing is still necessary closer to the departure time.

# Receiving the Briefing

Once you've given the briefer the required information, they'll brief you on at least the
following information, in this order, ommitting items where there's no relevant information:

 1. **Adverse Conditions:** major items that might cause you to immediately cancel the flight,
    such as runway closure at your departure or destination airport, six inch hailstones, a
    hurricane in progress, unacceptable IFR conditions etc.
 2. **Synopsis:** general weather pattern covering the major weather systems and air masses
    influencing the weather in the area where the proposed flight will take place
 3. **Current Conditions:** current surface ovservations for departure and destination airports
    (and alternates?), enroute PIREPs
 4. **Enroute Forecast:** the briefer will take you from departure and climbout through landing,
    summarizing the forecast for the period you'll be airborne
 5. **Destination Forecast:** forecast weather for the ETA
 6. **Winds Aloft:** you'll be given winds for the altitude closest to your proposed flight
    altitude for which there are measurements, which as at *3,000' intervals through to 12,000'*
    (some briefers may do the math and interpolate)
 7. **NOTAMs:** anything from runway closures to TFRs
 8. **ATC Delays:** pretty rare for pilots flying to anything other than major metropolitan
    airports. If you're flying to somewhere like O'Hare or JFK, the briefer will tell you of any
    holds due to flow control, or other measures designed to keep the traffic flowing
 9. **Anything Else:** the briefer will usually conclude by asking if there's anything else you'd
    like to know about. They can provide information about a range of topics, eg. customs,
    search and rescue, ATC services, preferred routes, and why the computer will take a route
    for one flight plan and not another, provide information about NOTAMs, TFRs, MOAs, MTRs,
    restricted areas, and other special use airspace.

# Other Sources of Weather Information

 - **Newspapers:** most newspapers provide valuable information about the weather, such as a weather
   map showing major weather systems around the country, and many also include a satellite picture.
   It can be good practice to study the weather every day and correlate it with what's actually
   happening out the window
 - **Pilots Automatic Telephone Weather Answering Service (PATWAS):** a continuous recording, made
   by a human, of meterological information for pilots. A PATWAS message is **recorded and updated
   at a minimum of every five hours, beginning at 0600 and ending at 2200 local time**. PATWAS is
   not intended as a substitute for a briefing by a FSS specialist, but can be useful as a preliminary
   briefing to help with go/no go decisions. *Phone numbers for PATWAS* are in the Chart Supplement.
 - **Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS):** a continuous telephone briefing service consisting
   of prerecorded weather and/or aeronautical information. It's offered by automated flight service
   stations and **provides weather briefings for an area or route. It also provides airspace procedures
   and special aviation announcements.** TIBS is available 24 hours a day and is updated as needed.
   TIBS phone numbers are also in the Chart Supplement.
 - **Cockpit Weather Uplink:** allows you receive weather information in the cockpit on a moving map
   display, typically associated with your GPS display. May (always?) require an XM subscription.
   Allows you to receive all types of weather products, including enroute and destination weather, as
   well as NEXRAD radar imagery while in flight.
 - **Hazardous In-flight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS):** a continuous broadcast of in-flight weather
   advisories. **It can be received over certain VOR and NDB stations** as indicated by a small black
   circle containing a reverse bold H in the navaid frequency box. **The purpose of HIWAS** is to keep
   you up to date with any hazardous weather such as thunderstorms, icing, strong winds, etc. These
   advisories of hazardous weather are **SIGMETS, convective SIGMETS, AIRMETS, AWWs, CWAs,** and **
   urgent PIREPs** (all of which will be discussed shortly).
 - **Enroute Flight Advisory Service (EFAS) (Flight Watch):** also known as *Flight Watch*, one of the
   best in-flight weather information services available to pilots. Flight Watch consists of trained
   specialists at selected FSSs who have attended additional weather courses to better assist pilots
   in flight. **The flight watch frequency is 122.0 MHz, and is the same everywhere between 5,000' and
   17,500'. Service is available 0600 - 2000 local time.**
 - **PIREPs:** *PIREPs* provide information on current conditions from pilots currently in the air.
   PIREPs are made to the FSS, EFAS, or an ATC facility. These are especially useful in places where
   weather reporting station are sparse.
