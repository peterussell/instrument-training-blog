# Runway Markings

Runways have three different types of markings: *visual*, *precision*, and *non-precision*.
They're all used for takeoffs and landings, and they all have several things in common such
as a centerline, a threshold, and designations (ie. the runway numbers), however there are
subtle differences that separate them:

 - a **non-precision instrument runway** is one established for an airport with an instrument
   approach that *doesn't have vertical guidance*. Examples are VOR, Localizer, NDB, or
   GPS (LNAV) approaches
    - the difference from a *visual runway* is that it has an **aiming point marking**
      (sometimes referred to as the *fixed distance markers*) which look like **two
      large white rectangles**
    - the beginnings of these markings is 1,00' from the runway threshold
    - *(note that some visual runways can have aiming point markings if it's at least 4,000'
      long and used by jet aircraft)*
    - to understand the aiming point markings we need to understand the precision instrument
      runway first...
 - a **precision instrument runway** is associated with an IAP with a glidepath (PAR) or
   glideslope (ILS).
    - the aiming point markings represent **the location on the runway where the glidepath
      or glideslope would theoretically intersect the runway *('theoretically' because the
      glideslope on an ILS approache flares electronically about 24' above the runway)*
    - on an ILS, these markings represent the place where the airplane's glideslope antenna
      would touch down, if it had landing gear
    - **one of the most important concepts behind these *aiming point markings* is the give
      a pilot a place to aim for on the runway (even without any glideslope), or when
      transitioning from IMC to VMC**

# Runway Touchdown (etc.)

 - the *touchdown zone** is hte first 3,000' of the runway, measured from the runway threshold
 - the **touchdown zone markings** are white stripes, **spaced at 500' intervals** on the
   runway, to provide distance information
 - **runway side stripes** provide contrast between the landing surface and surrounding area
   (dirt etc.)
 - **approach lighting** (already covered in depth before)
    - an airport with a **precision instrument runway** will have an ALS **2,400' - 3,000'** long
    - an airport with a **non-precision instrument runway** typically have ALS **1,400' - 1,500'**

# Runway Lighting

 - **runway edge lighting** borders both sides of the runway, are normally white, and spaced 200' apart
    - they are 'normally' white because **on an instrument runway they're *yellow* on the last
      2,000' or last half of the runway**, whichever is less
 - the **beginning of the runway** is marked with green threshold lights
 - the **far end of the runway** is marked with red lights
 - **taxiway edge lighting** is blue

These are the basic lights, although at fancier airports you may find additional lighting:

 - green taxiway center lighting
 - flashing yellow runway guard lighting
    - these consist of three yellow lights used to denote a hold position for airplanes and ground
      vehicles (eg. before yellow-dashed taxiway hold lines)
 - **pink spots** are geographic position markings, which denote places used either as holding
   points or for position reporting while on the taxiway
 - **ILS critical areas** (covered later)
 - **in-pavement red stop bar lights** - used at intersections of illuminated taxiways and runways
   for operations when the RVR is less than 6 (600 feet RVR). When you see these lights on a
   taxiway you should stop and never cross them until instructed to do so by ATC (the controller
   will usually turn them off when it's OK to cross)
 - a **No Entry** sign sometimes exists where one-way taxiways exist, or where surface roads for
   automobiles exist that can be easily confused with taxiways
 - additional runway lighting on a *precision instrument runway* consists of **runway centerline
   lighting (RCLS)** (50' intervals, from 75' from the threshold), and **touchdown zone lighting
   (TDZL)**, which are two rows of transverse light bars situated symmetrically about the
   runway centerline (white bars perpendicular to the centerline on either side). TDZL starts
   100' beyond the landing threshold, and extends the width of the touchdown zone, or 3,000'
   beyond the landing treshold, or to the midpoint of the runway, whichever is less
 - **taxiway leadoff lights** are on some runways, which extend from the runway centerline to
   a spot on an exit taxiway - these are **alternating green and yellow**

# Taxiway Markings

 - taxiways are idenfitied by a continuous yellow line with parallel double yellow lines on the
   outer edges of the taxi surface
 - signs:
    - for the taxiway you're *on*: yellow text on a black background
    - for *intersecting* taxiways: black text on a yellow background
 - the **runway hold markings** are 4 yellow lines, 2 dashed, 2 solid
    - if you're on the dashed side you *must cross*
    - if you're on the solid side you *must **not** cross* until cleared (at a towered airport)
    - *note: the FAA says your airplane isn't over the runway hold markings until all parts of
      the airplane are across it*
 - **white on red** signs identify runways, showing the runway identifiers (eg. 34L) and position
 - **all white on red signs are mandatory airport instructions**
 - some airports have taxiways that interfere with the runway safety area, such as a taxiway
   crossing behind the threshold of a runway
    - holding position signs in this case are shown by white on red lettering, showing the
      identifier of the runway and the text 'APCH', eg. '15APCH'
    - at **tower controlled airports this is a mandatory holding point**

# ILS Critical Area

 - this area is defined in order to **prevent your airplane from distorting signals sent by the
   glideslope and localizer antennas**
 - ILS ctirical area hold lines are a pair of parallel lines with smaller sets of perpindicular
   parallel lines between them
 - if you're told to avoid the ILS critical area by ATC, then you know to keep away from it (hold
   short of these lines until ATC clears you to move)

# Additional Runway Markings

 - **yellow chevrons** indicate that the surface is unsuitable for **taxiing, taking off, or
   landing** (don't go there for any reason)
 - **white arrows** pointing in one direction form a **displaced threshold**, this **can be
   used for taxi, takeoff, or roll out after landing, but *not for landing***
 - a runway or taxiway with a **large yellow X** painted on it means this is **a closed or
   temporarily closed surface**

# Pilot Controlled Airport Lighting

 - three different intensities of runway edge lighting (high, medium, low) are available at
   many airports
 - you can activate these by clicking the mic button on the CTAF frequency
 - rates (within 5 seconds)
    - 7 clicks = high intensity (HIRL)
    - 5 clicks = medium intensity (MIRL)
    - 3 clicks = low intensity (LIRL)
 - once activated, the lights stay on for **15 minutes**
 - it's a good idea to re-activate the lights on short final just to make sure they don't
   unexpectedly turn off during landing
 - pilot controlled lighting **is denoted by *negative symbology*, ie. white lettering in
   a black filled circle**
    - it can be used for multiple types of lighting system - for any lighting system with
      this symbology, it means the lighting is *pilot controlled*
    - *examples: VASI, PAPI, approach lighting, REIL*
    - a **small black circle embedded on top of the bigger black circle** indicates that
      the hight intensity and the medium intensity runway lighting are controlled by the
      pilot
 - at some airports there are two small stroboscopic lights near the runway threshold, called
   **Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL)**
    - REILs provide rapid and positive identification of a runway that's surrounded
      by other lighting and lacks contrast with the surrounding terrain
 - sometimes, the VASI or PAPI may also be under control of the pilot controlled lighting
 - see the Chart Supplement for controlling lighting at a specific airport

# Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI)

 - a VASI can have a number of different combinations of lights (bars), the most common
   is the 2 bar VASI
    - white over white, you're high as a kite
    - red over white, you're alright
    - red over red, you're dead
 - VASIs are visible from 3-5 miles during the day, up to 20 miles at night
 - regulations require you to fly at or above the glideslope when approaching a runway equipped
   with a VASI in Class B, C, and D airspace
 - **you can count on obstruction clearance for 10 degrees either side of the runway centerline,
   up to four miles out from the threshold**

# Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI)

 - a PAPI is an arrangement of four horizontal lights
 - if you're above glidepath, you get four white lights, below: four red, on: two red, two white

# Tri-Color VASI

 - normally consists of a **single light unit projecting a 3 color visual approach path**
    - **above: amber**
    - **below: red**
    - **on: green**
 - weaker than a normal VASI: useful range of 1/2 to 1 mile during day, up to 5 miles at night

# 3-Bar VASI

 - seen usually at larger air carrier airports, to serve the jumbo jet crowd
 - exists to solve the problem where the *pilot* is on the proper glidepath, but the *passengers
   at the back of the airplane aren't*
 - **3-bar VASIs have two glidepaths**
    - one is angled at approximately 3 degrees, and shows red/red over white
    - the higher glidepath is approximately 3.25 degrees - long bodied aircraft use this and
      see a color combination of red/white over white
 - for smaller airplanes it's generally good to use the *lower glidepath* to avoid steep descents
    - **look for red/red over white as the appropriate on-glidepath indiciation for a 3-bar VASI
      in a small airplane**
