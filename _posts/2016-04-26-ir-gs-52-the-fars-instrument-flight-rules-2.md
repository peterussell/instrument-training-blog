# FAR 91.175 - Takeoff and Landing Under IFR

 - [FAR 91.175][far-91-175]
 - the regulation that tells you when it's legal to leave the minimum altitude on your approach and land
 - begins by stating that, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator (the FAA), when an instrument
   letdown to a civil airport is necessary, you must use an IAP prescribed for the airport in FAR Part 97
    - essentially means you aren't allowed to make up your own approach
 - the **"otherwise authorized"** part is for people that have their own private approaches to their
   own airports
    - these approaches have all been surveyed and flight checked by the FAA at the owner's expense

**The Main Part of 91.175**

 - says that when making an instrument approach and descending to a minimum altitude (MDA or DA), **you
   can't leave that altitude unless you have one or more items associated with the runway or approach
   lights in sight *and* have the required flight visibility as shown on the approach chart**

When there's an MDA or DA established for an IAP, a pilot can not operate below the MDA or continue
an approach below the authorized DA unless three general conditions are met:

 1. The airplane must *continuously* be in a position from which a descent to landing on the intended
    runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers
     - this means that if at any time you feel your airplane has drifted too far off course and you're
       operating below the MDA or DA, then you must immediately fly the missed approach procedure
 2. The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed for the approach being used
     - *flight* visibility (not vis reported by the tower or weather station) is used here
     - *we won't talk about Part 121 or 135 operators, which have slightly different rules**
 3. The pilot must have at least one of the following visual references in sight (meaning it must be
    succinctly visible and identifiable) for the intended runway of landing
     - the **approach lighting system** (this only allows you to descend to 100' above the TDZE)
     - the **threshold**
     - the **threshold markings**
     - the **threshold lights**
     - the **runway end identifier lights** (REIL)
     - the **visual approach slope indicator** (VASI)
     - the **touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings**
     - the **touchdown zone lights**
     - the **runway or runway markings**
     - the **runway lights**
 - it's important to note that there are **10 items total**, 9 of which are on the runway side of the
   threshold

# FAR 91.177 - Minimum Altitudes for IFR Operations

 - [FAR 91.177][far-91-177]
 - states that you can't operate lower than the minimum altitudes shown on instrument charts, **unless
   you're authorized to do so by ATC**
    - ATC might do this when they have a lower Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) or Minimum Instrument
      Altitude (MIA) lower than the Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA), which they often do
 - **if there is no minimum altitude on the chart:**
    - *example: if you wanted to fly between two VORs or GPS from waypoint to waypoint, which has no airway
      between them, and therefore the chart shows no MEA*
    - in this case, you're **required to maintain at least 1,000' above the highest obstacle within a
      horizontal distance of 4NM of the course to be flown in a non-mountainous area, or 2,000' above
      ... in a mountainous area**
    - how do you determine whether the area is 'mountainous'? It's listed in the AIM, which specifies
      which areas are designated as mountainous

# FAR 91.183 - IFR Radio Communication

 - [FAR 91.183][far-91-183]
 - a PIC operating IFR is required to keep a continuous watch (well, listen) on the radio frequency,
   meanining no turning down the volume for a rest (which seems a bit silly anyway)
 - when **not under radar control** ("1234 Bravo, radar contact lost"), you're required to report to
   ATC the **time and altitude when passing all designated reporting points** (also known as
   *compulsory reporting points* on the IFR chart, or reporting points given by ATC)
 - if you're under radar control, you only need to report your time and altitude at any points ATC
   specifically requests
 - you're also required to report:
    - **any unforecast weather** along your route of flight
    - **any information that relates to the safety of the flight** (eg. bird activity, etc.)

# FAR 91.185 - Two-way Radio Comm Failure

 - [FAR 91.185][far-91-185]
 - if you experience radio failure **under VFR conditions**, continue in VFR conditions and land as
   soon as feasible

If you experience a two-way radio communication failure in IFR conditions then the first thing to do is
squawk 7600 (7700 if experiencing an emergency). Then, you need to decide three things: what *route*
you should fly, what *altitude* you should fly, and *when to fly the approach*.

**What route should you fly?**

 - AVE-F: Assigned, Vectored, Expected, Filed

**What altitude should you fly?**

 - MEA: The *highest* of: MEA (Minimum Enroute Altitude), Expected, Assigned
 - *what if there's a short segment of your route that has an MEA of 12,000'?*
    - then you'd climb to 12,000 when appropriate, stay there until these minimum airway altitudes
      allow you to return to either your assigned or expected
 - *expected*: if you've been told to expect a different altitude at a specific place or time, *do
   what you were told to expect*

**When should you fly the approach (or leave the clearance limit, if appropriate)?**

The regulations are pretty detailed:

 a. when the clearance limit is an IAF**, commence descent or
    descent and approach as close as possible to the EFC time if one has been received, or if no
    EFC has been given, as close as possible to the ETA as calculated from the filed or amended
    (with ATC) ETE
 b. if the clearance limit is **not an IAF**, leave the clearance limit at the EFC if one has been
    given, or if no EFC has been given, upon arrival over the clearance limit, and proceed to an
    IAF and commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA as calculated
    from the filed or amended (with ATC) ETE

Pete's Summary:

 - so there are two cases, one where you're cleared to the IAF, one where you're cleared to a fix
   short of the IAF
 - in either case, if you have an EFC, hold at the clearance limit until the EFC and then proceed
 - if you have no EFC
    - if an IAF, wait until the ETA then start the approach
    - if not an IAF, proceed straight pas the clearance limit to an IAF, then wait until the ETA
      and start the approach
 - also, if you're basing an approach from the IAF on your ETA, **and you arrive at the IAF when
   your ETA has already passed**, then just continue and fly the approach without delay

**Important notes on the ETE**

Based on the above, there are two important notes about the ETE based on that you could be relying
on it heavily in a lost comm situation:

 1. when filing, file your ETE to the **Initial Approach Fix** (not the destination airport)
 2. if your ETE changes significantly in flight, adivse ATC

# FAR 91.187 - Operation under IFR in Controlled Airpsace: Malfunction Reports

 - [FAR 91.187][far-91-187]
 - as PIC under IFR in *controlled airspace*, you're required to report as soon as practical
   to ATC **any lamfunctions of navigational, approach, or communication equipment** occuring
   in flight
 - this requires three pieces of information
    1. Aircraft identification
    2. equipment affected
    3. degree to which the capability of the pilot to operate under IFR in the ATC system is impaired
    4. the nature-extent of assistance needed from ATCA

# FAR 91.205 - Powered Civil Aircraft with Standard Category U.S. Airworthiness Certificates: Instrument and Equipment Requirements

 - [FAR 91.205][far-91-205]
 - states which instruments are required to be operation in order to fly IFR
 - first, you need all the equipment required for day VFR (A TOMATO FLAMES):
    - Airspeed indicator
    - Tachometer (for each engine)
    - Oil Pressure indicator
    - Manifold pressure indicator (for each engine)
    - Altimeter
    - Temperature indicator (for each liquid cooled engine)
    - Oil temperator indicator (for each air cooled engine)
    - Fuel gauge indicating the quantity of fuel in each tank
    - Landing gear position indicator, if equipped with retractable landing gear
    - Anti-collision lights
    - Magnetic compass
    - ELT
    - Seatbelts (for each occupant two years or older), a shoulder harness for each front seat in
      airplanes manufactured after July 18 1978

 - and for night VFR (FLAPS):
    - the equipment required for day VFR, plus...
    - Fuses (one spare set, or three spare fuses of each kind required, accessible to the pilot)
    - Landing light (only if for hire)
    - Anticollision lights (this comes up twice: if registered after March 11 1996 they're required all
      the time, but before that (and after August 11 1971) they're required only for night)
    - Position lights
    - Source of electricity (alternator, generator)

Note that again, you're only required to have them if your airplane is equipped for it. For example,
if your airplane has circuit breakers then you don't need to carry fuses.

**Now, for IFR - GRABCARDD**

 - Generator or Alternator
 - Radio/nav equipment appropriate for flight
 - Attitude indcator
 - Ball (inclinometer)
 - Clock (hours, minutes, seconds, analog or digital)
 - Altimeter - sensitive (able to be set)
 - Rate of Turn indicator
 - Directional Gyro
 - DME (above FL240)

# FAR 91.211 - Use of Supplemental Oxygen

 - [FAR 91.211][far-91-211]
 - requires required flight crewmembers to use supplemental oxygen when:
    - flying more than 30 minutes **above 12,500'**
    - at any time **above 14,000'**
 - passengers:
    - must be *provided* with supplemental oxygen at **above 15,000'**

*Note: for pressurized airplanes, these apply to the cabin pressure altitude, so if you pressurize
the cabin to 13,000', then the supplemental oxygen rules for between 12,500' and 14,000' apply (30 mins)*

**Also, because it's pure oxygen, be careful with any source of flammable material. *Lip balm and
lip gloss are both petroleum based, and should be probably removed before using supplemental oxygen.
Same goes for hair sprays, alcohol, perfumes, etc.***

# FAR 91.215 - ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use

 - [FAR 91.215][far-91-215]
 - transponders are often known as Mode 3/A 4096 code capable transponders (4096 is the number of
   discrete codes that can be used with one)
 - most transponders also have **Mode C** or **Mode S** capability, otherwise known as having
   **altitude reporting capability**

**Mode C Transponders** are required when operating in any of the following areas:

 - Class A, Class B, and Class C airspace
 - all airspace above the ceiling and within the lateral boundaries of Class B or Class C airspace
   up to 10,000' MSL
 - in all airspace within 30NM of certain airpors listed in appendix D, section 1 of FAR Part 91,
   from the surface up to 10,000' MSL (known as the **Mode C veil** around Class B airspace)
 - **in all airspace of the 48 contiguous states (and DC) at and above 10,000' MSL**
    - excluding airspace at and below 2,500' above the surface

This regulation also determines how the transponder must be used:

 - it requires you to keep your transponder turned on while in the airspace listed above, or in any
   controlled airspace, as well as keeping it turned to the "ALT" mode prior to moving on the airport
   surface
    - *note: really? What about transponders that automatically set to ALT on takeoff? They're in
      standby the whole time you're taxiing at the airport*
 - in addition to it being turned on, it must also operate in Mode C (altitude reporting) if so equipped

**Transponder or Mode C Failure**

 - what happens if my Mode C fails in flight or some intermediate stop on a XC flight?
 - ATC can **waive the Mode C requirement at any time**
    - simply call Center or approach controller with your request
 - **if you don't have a transponder** then ATC wants at least a one-hour notice before they approve
   flight in an area requiring a transponder

# FAR 91.411 - Altimeter System and Altitude Reporting Equipment Tests and Inspections

 - [FAR 91.411][far-91-411]
 - you can't operate your airplane in controlled airspace under IFR unless, within the **preceding 24
   calendar months**, each of the following has been tested and inspected:
    - each static pressure system
    - each altimeter instrument
    - each automatic pressure altitude reporting system
 - this inspection will be logged in the aircraft logbooks

# FAR 91.413 - ATC Transponder Tests and Inspections

 - [FAR 91.413][far-91-413]
 - you can't use an ATC transponder unless, within the **preceding 24 calendar months** it has been
   tested and inspected
 - this will also be logged in the aircraft logbooks

# NTSB Regulations

 - the NTSB is reponsible for aircraft accidents, incidents, and overdue aircraft
 - under certain conditions you may have to notify them or file a report if you are involved in an
   aircraft accident in which:
    - any person receives serious injury, or...
    - the aircraft receives substantial damage
 - part **830 of the Board's regulations** governs the reporting of accidents, incidents, damage to
   aircraft, cargo, mail, or injury to any required crewmembers

**NTSB 803.2 Definitions**

It's important to know the definitions of **serious injury** and **substantial damage**, since many
reporting obligations hinge on these terms.

There are five specific definitions for **serious injury**:

 1. requires hospitlization for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date the
    injury was received
 2. results in the fracture of a bone, except simple fractures of the fingers, toes, or nose
 3. causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage
 4. involves any internal organ damage
 5. involves second or third degree burns, or burns affecting more than 5% of the body surface

**Substantial Damage** is defined as damage or failure that adversely affects the structural strength,
performance, or flight characteristics of the aircraft and which would normally require **major repair
or replacement** of the affected component.

The following are **not considered substantial damage**:

 1. engine failure or damage limited to an engine if *only one engine fails or is damaged*
 2. bent fairings or cowling, dented skin, small puncture holes in the skin or fabric
 3. ground damage to rotor or propellor baldes and damage to landing gear, wheels, tires, flaps,
    engine acccessories, brakes, or wingtips

An **accident** is an occurrency associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between
the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight, and all such persons have disembarked,
and in which **any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial
damage.**

An **incident** means an occurrence other than an accident, associated wit hthe operation of an aircraft,
which affects or could affect the safety of operations.

# NTSB 830.5 - Immediate Nofication

The operator of an aircraft must immediately and by the most expediate means available notify the nearest
NTSB field office when an aircraft accident or any of the following listed incidents occur:

 1. flight control system malfunction or failure
 2. inability of any required flight crewmember to perform this or her normal flight duties as a result
    of injury or illness
 3. failure of structural components of a turbine engine excluding compressor and turbine blads and vanes
 4. in-flight fire
 5. aicraft collide in flight
 6. damage to property, other than the aircraft, **estimated to exceed $25,000** for repair, or fair
    market value in the event of total loss
 7. release of all or a portion of a propellor blade from an aircraft, excluding release caused solely
    by ground contact
 8. a complete loss of information, excluding flickering, from more than 50% of an aircraft's
    cockpit displays
 9. an aircraft is overdue and believed to have been involved in an accident

# NTSB 830.10 - Preservation of Aircraft Wreckage, Mail, Cargo, and Records

 - basically says that if you're the operator of an aircraft involved in an accident or incident, it's your
   job to protect the wreckage and everything associated with it until the NTSB arrives
    - avoid disturbing the wreckage
    - do so **only if necessary to help persons injured or trapped**, or...
    - to protect the wreckage from further damage, or...
    - protect the public from injury
 - if you need to move anything, take notes, photographs, sketches, etc. to record its original condition

# NTSB 830.15 - Reports and Statements to be Filed

 - the operator of an aircraft must file a report...
    - **within 10 days of an accident**
    - **after 7 days if an overdue aircraft is still missing**
 - a report on an *incident* for which immediate notification is required shall be filed only as requested
   by an authorized representative of the Board.
