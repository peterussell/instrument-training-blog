# Condensation and Cloud Formation

 - clouds generally need to be at least 4,000' thick for significant precipitaiton
   to occur
 - precipitation can be rain, hail, snow, ice pellets or grains, or freezing
   rain
 - **precipitation is any or all forms of water particles, whether liquid or solid,
   that fall from the sky and reach the ground**
    - it's distinguished from clouds or dew in that it falls and makes contact
      with the earth's surface
 - when flying near an airport reporting light or heavier precipitation, you can
   probably expect the clouds to be at least 4,000' thick - a useful tip when
   trying to figure out whether you can climb above them to avoid colder,
   freezing temperatures aloft

# Lapse Rates and Temperature Inversions

 - the sun heats the earth, not particularly the air around the earth (the air
   largely lets solar radiation pass through it)
 - so how does the air get warm? It's mostly due to the heated surface that sits
   next to the air that causes the air to heat up
    - **it's the *surface of the earth* that heats or cools the air directly
 - as we move away from the heated surface, the air cools - we might say the
   air temperature lapses with an increase in altitude
    - this is called the **Temperature Lapse Rate**
 - although we covered in intial training the idea that the *standard atmopsheric
   lapse rate* is a steady 3.5 deg F (2 deg C), this isn't entirely accurate,
   but it's still good enough for us to use in estimations
 - to identify the *actual lapse rate*, meteorologists across the nation send up
   *radiosondes* twice daily, which ascend on a balloon and take measurements
   of the actual *ambient temperature lapse rate*
 - in areas on clear days where it's super hot (like the desert), it's not uncommon
   for the air 5' off the ground to be 105 deg F, while above 10' it's as cool
   as 90 deg F
    - this super hot air at the surface can cause turbulence, or other effects,
      including small pockets of rising air amongst other more stable air (=bumps)

# Temperature Inversions

 - while it's common for air to cool as it rises, sometimes it gets hotter as
   altitude increases, which is called a *temperature inversion*
 - there are two types of inversions:
    - a **surface inversion**
    - an **inversion aloft**

**Surface Inversion**

 - this is the most common type
 - frequently forms around sunset and lasts until midmorning
 - **cause:** a setting sun allows the surface temperature to drop quickly,
   especially on cloudless, calm nights (in the absence of cloud cover, the
   earth cools quickly)
 - however, *with* cloud cover the water droplets in the clouds absorb radiant
   heat from the ground and re-radiate this heat back toward the ground, which
   absorbs the heat energy again
    - this exchange continues all night long and keeps surface temperatures
      warmer than they would be on a clear night
 - **as the earth cools, the air next to it cools** resulting in cooler air next
   to the earth and warmer air above it: a temperature inversion
 - the **base** of a surface inversion is the surface of the earth, while the
   **top** of the inversion occurs where the temperature lapse rate resumes its
   normal decrease with height
    - typically the top of the surface inversion occurs within a few hundred
      feet of the ground
 - a surace inversion can result in a temperature increase of 25 deg F with a
   250' increase in height above the surface
 - this can be particularly noticeable/impressive in places like Alaska, where
   the surface is very cool but the radiation is warm
 - long nights and short days contribute to this kind of inversion
 - **winds of 7 kts or more can start causing the air to mix, causing the
   inversion to disappear**
 - **convective currents** (small parcels of vertical rising air) can also help
   to break up an inversion, which occurs frequntly in the desert, meaning
   inversions rarely last past mid-morning due to convective currents mixing
   up the air

**Inversion Aloft**

 - caused by warmer air moving horizontally over colder air, or by air aloft
   that is descending
 - this air descends and compresses as it reaches a cooler layer below it
   (it's trying to descend with other air on top of it trying to descend,
   squishing it) - this compression causes it to heat up and create an
   inversion layer aloft
 - sometimes also called a *subsidence inversion*
 - it's quite common near the west coast, where warm, high-pressure air subsides
   (lowers) onto the cool, moist inflow of air from the ocean
 - a pilot faces a decreasing temperature lapse rate when departing an airport
   under an inversion aloft
    - the climb is initially made in cool air
    - upon entering the bottom of the inversion the air becomes warmer
    - at the top of the inversion, a decreasing temperature lapse rate is once
      again present

# Effects of Temperature Inversions

 - often noticeable as warm rising smoke from a chimney or fire flattens out
 - as the air of the fire matches the heated air in the inversion, it can't
   rise anymore and so has to move horizontally
 - similarly, a temperature inversion acts to flatten cloud tops
    - layer type clouds (otherwise known as *stratus*) are another visible
      indication of a temperature inversion

# What to Expect in an Inversion

The visible signs of an inversion should clue pilots to expect several possible
flight conditions:

 - temperature inversions increase the likelihood of cloud formation
    - since cool air exists on the surface, the air might start to condense,
      forming fog or low clouds
 - visibility beneath an inversion can be quite low - objects look further away
   than they actually are
 - temperature inversions can indicate the **presence of low-level wind shear**
    - an inversion can allow a warmer, faster layer of air aloft to move,
      unrestricted by surface friction
    - airs of different densities tend not to mix, so they slip past each other
      at possibly quite high rates
    - such conditions are conducive to a *low level jet stream*
    - in the presence of an inversion, **if surface winds are calk, and winds at
      a few hundred to a few thousand feet AGL are in the 25kt range, be prepared
      for possible wind shear**
 - temperature inversions indicate the presence of stable air (on either side of
   the inversion limits)
    - this is because warm air can't rise past the inversion (the temperatures
      match), and cool air can't descend through the inversion - therefore there
      are less small parcels of air on either side rising or descending = less
      turbulence
    - this is **especially true in the warmer air on top of the inversion**

**For Instrument Pilots**

 - indicates that **convective clouds are not likely to form**
    - the inversion stops the rising warmer air forming into towering clouds
    - *example: if you're flying aboe the clouds and see an extensive flat
      (stratified) top at 10,000', then you could feel comfortable assuming
      that there are no t hunderstorms within those clouds, given the low tops and
      stable nature of the air*

**Wind Shear**

Wind Shear is a condition where **the velocity and/or direction of the wind changes
drastically over a small distance.** Wind shear can occur at all altitudes and
in all directions, and can result in a sudden loss of lift.

Large crab angles on an approach to an airport that's reporting calm surface
winds are another good clue as to the presence of wind shear.

If you're descending into a **low stratus deck** on an instrument approach, be
prepared for a wind correction angle change.

# Atmospheric Stability (Warm over Cold, Cold over Warm)

 - the atmosphere is *stable* when it resists the upward movement of air
 - it's *unstable* when it permits or amplifies this upward movement
    - in other words, stable air, if given an upward shove, sinks back to its
      original level
    - unstable air, if shoved upward, continues to climb upward of its own volition
 - atmospheric stability can be visualized in two scenarios:
    - warm air on top of cooler air - stable, cold air = dense = bottom; this
      happens at sunset when the earth cools, cools the air next to it, while
      there's still warm air aloft *(note: this is a temperature inversion, which
      is why we think of inversions as stable)*; **characteristics:** smooth,
      murky air
    - cool air on top of warmer air - unstable, cold air wants to sink and the
      warm air wants to rise; can happen at sunrise, heated surface heats the
      air next to it, wants to rise through the (still cool) air aloft;
      **characteristics:** turbulent, clear air
 - it's worth noting that the earth's surface doesn't heat evenly, so these air
   parcels of rising and cooling air happen unevenly all over the place

# Adiabatic Cooling

 - literally means "without gain or loss of heat"
 - the idea is that when you *expand a parcel of air* (by lifting it, which
   decreases the atmospheric pressure around it, allowing it to expand), there is
   energy that has been used to expand the parcel
 - the result is that the **molecules slow down due to the expansion**
 - in turn, because the molecules are slower, there's **less friction** and
   therefore the temperature decreases
    - the main idea is that the air doesn't *lose heat*, it's *generating
      less heat* because the molecules have less energy, aren't moving as fast,
      and aren't creating as much friction
 - similarly, if you lower a parcel of air, increasing the pressure around it,
   the molecules gain energy, start to move faster, and therefore heat up as
   the air parcel compresses

**Compressing = heating up, decompressing = cooling down**

# Rising Parcels of Air

 - given the information above on Adiabatic Cooling, we know that rising
   individual parcels of air cool and expand as they ascend
 - **a vertically moving parcel of air changes temperature at a *constant
   rate* of 5.4 deg F (3 deg C) for every thousand feet of movement** - *as
   long as that parcel of air remains unsaturated (doesn't form a cloud)*
 - this is called the... **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate**
 - recall that the atmosphere that the parcel of air is moving through is *also*
   changing temperature with altitude, but this is where it becomes important that
   the ambient (atmospheric) lapse rate is inconsistent - this is where we get
   our variety of clouds from
 - as long as there's a temperature differential (where the air around the air
   parcel is *cooler* than the air parcel) then the air parcel will continue
   to rise
    - these relative lapse rates are what determine whether a parcel will never
      rise, rise at a constant rate, slow as it rises, or accelerate as it
      rises
 - if the atmosphere encourages the rising of the parcel of air, then it's
   *unstable*, if it stops the rising parcel, then it's *stable*

**Ambient Lapse Rate vs. Parcel of Air Lapse Rate**

Remember, the lapse rate of a *parcel of air* is known at 5.4 deg F per 1,000',
so, if the *ambient temperature* is:

 1. cooling at a rate *faster* than 5.4 deg F/1000', the parcel of air will
    continue to accelerate upward
 2. cooling at a rate *slower* than 5.4 deg F/1000', the parcel of air will
    be cooler than the ambient temperature at any given point, and will sink
 3. cools at *exactly* 5.4 deg F/1000', then the parcel of air is neutral, and
    won't move unless something pushes it (and when it stops being pushed it'll
    just stay where it's left)

# Saturated Parcels of Rising Air

So far we've considered dry parcels of air, now we'll add moisture to the mix.

 - once these rising parcels cool to within a few degrees of their dewpoint,
   condensation occurs and clouds form
 - **when clouds form, *heat is released into the parcel* as the water goes from
   invisible vapor to visible moisture**
    - in the course of rearranging themselves into a new formation, the water
      molecules *shed heat*
    - this **latent heat** is added to the temperature of the air parcel, thus
      changing the behavoir of that parcel of air

**An air parcel that's creating clouds doesn't cool as quickly as one that
isn't, because the water molecules are adding heat to the air parcel.**

 - ie. the air parcel *remains warmer*
 - a moist air parcel changes temperature based on the latent heat energy
   already contained within the water molecules of that parcel

**Saturated parcels of air cool at rates between approximately 2 to 5 deg F,
with an average lapse rate of 3.5 deg F.**

The main idea here is that at the point where a parcel of air becomes saturated
and starts forming visual moisture, its *lapse rate* decreases, so it stays
warmer. Therefore, if a parcel of initially has a lapse rate of 5.4 deg F, within
an atmosphere that also has a lapse rate of 5.4 deg F, it's neutral.

However, if we push this parcel of air up the side of a mountain and let it cool
until within a few degrees of its dewpoint, then the saturation and formation
of visible moisture *changes the lapse rate of the parcel of air*. It now has
a lapse rate of (for example) 3.5 deg F, which is now less than the ambient
lapse rate. Therefore the parcel of air starts to accelerate upward, forming a
towering cloud structure.

In other words, while the dry parcel of air was neutral with respect to the
ambient air until it reached saturation, it's unstable after reaching saturation.
