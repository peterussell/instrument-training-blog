# Electronics 101

 - radio waves are the part of the electromagnetic spectrum used for aviation navigation and communication
 - lower frequency radio waves:
   - have a longer wavelength
   - are more likely to stay near the ground, making reception beyond the horizon more likely
   - are more affected by atmospheric phenomena, eg. lightning and St. Elmo's Fire
   - *examples are NDB stations/ADF receivers*
 - high frequency radio waves (eg. VHF 'Very High Frequency')
   - have a shorter wavelength
   - require line of sight (transmitters hidden by obstruction or the horizon are less likely to be received)
   - are less affected by atmospheric phenomena
   - *examples are DME, VOR (Very high frequency Omindirectional Radio Range)*

# VOR Navigation

 - the VOR airway system saw widespread implementation in the 1950s, and makes up the Federal Airway system which is still in use today
 - VOR allows you to track to or from a station on any one of 360 radials
 - a VOR works by transmitting two signals:
   - a constant-phase signal
   - an out-of-phase signal
   - the out of phase signal is out of phase with the first signal in each position around the VOR, except at magnetic North
   - your VOR receiver measures the phase difference between the two signals to determine which radial you're on

**Identifying VOR Stations**

 - **when flying IFR it's *very* important to identify the VOR station**, for two reasons:
   1. to make sure you have the correct station
   2. to make sure the station is functioning correctly
 - tune in the station and listen to the VORs identifier. The morse code identifier is repeated very **5 seconds**, sometimes with a voice representation of the identifier every **15 seconds**
 - if a station is undergoing routine maintenance the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code: (- . ... -), or the code may be removed
 - VOR stations have automatic monitoring that shuts down the station if there's an equipment problem (and alerts authorities)
 - they also have a standby transmitter which is activated automatically when signal problems occur

**VOR Limitations**

 - because VORs transmit at the high end of the electromagnetic spectrum, they generally require **line-of-sight** to be received
 - the FAA places limits on the altitude and distance over which VORs can be used for navigation, these are shown on IFR charts (unless a NOTAM indicates otherwise)
 - in general, VORs are good for least 40 miles at normal IFR altitudes

**VOR Scalloping**

 - VOR Scalloping is when the VOR needle unexpectedly swings
 - it can be caused by certain propellor RPMs, and can cause the needle to fluctuate by as much as +/- 6 degrees
 - if you see the issue, try changing the RPM slighly and see if it fixes the problem
 - **terrain** can also interfere with VHF reception and can cause scalloping

**VOR Components**

 - the **VOR receiver** (probably as part of a *navcomm* unit, ie. both a navigation and communications receiver)
 - the **vertical needle**, also known as the **Course Deviation Indicator (CDI)**
 - a **signal flag** (TO/FROM), also known as an **ambiguity indicator**
 - an **omni bearing selector (OBS)** or **course selector** knob
 - a circular, **moveable compass card**, controlled by the course selector

# VOR Navigation

*Note: there's a long section on VOR nav that's already covered by the PPL syllabus. I'll omit it here except for any new concepts.*

 - each of the five dots on a VOR display **represents 2 degrees** of deviation from the center of the radial, therefore how far in miles from the radial you are depends on distance from the station
   - *for example, a deflection of 2 dots at 10 miles is much further (in miles) from the radial than a 2 dot deflection at 1 mile*
   - **Calculating distance from the radial:** at 60 NM, 1 degree = 1 mile. Therefore at 30 NM, 1 degree = 1/2 mile (ie. each dot represents 1 mile offset from the radial at 30 NM)
