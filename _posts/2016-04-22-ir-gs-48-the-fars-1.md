# Part 61 - Requirements for Certs, Ratings, Authorizations

 - [FAR 61.3][far-61-3] - to act as PIC or required flight crewmember, you must have your:
    - pilot certificate
    - medical certificate (if required)
    - photo ID
 - these can be inspected by a member of the FAA, NTSB, TSA, federal/state/local law enforcement,
   or US customs agents (acting on behalf of the FAA)

**IFR Requirements**

 - to act as PIC of an aircraft operating in weather less than the minimums required for VFR, you must have:
    - an instrument rating
    - an instrument clearance
    - be instrument current
    - be in an airplane legal to fly on instruments
 - note: an ATP supersedes an instrument rating (and commercial) - in any case where we discuss having an
   instrument rating, an ATP certificate will suffice

# FAR 61.51 - Pilot Logbooks

 - [FAR 61.51][far-61-51] covers how time is logged
 - *Instrument Time* can only be logged when **control of the aircraft is mainted solely by reference to the
   instruments**
    - it's possible to be flying in VMC on an IFR flight plane, eg. above a solid undercast layer
    - you *can't* log that as instrument time because you probably didn't need to fly by reference to your
      instruments
    - however, it may provide a false horizon, in which case you'll be flying based on what your instruments
      are telling you, in this case you *can* log instrument time
    - if you're flying in IMC but can see patches of earth, then you *can* log this time if you're still
      maintaining control of the airplane based on instrument references
    - night flight over a wide expanse of water with low light could easily be logged as instrument time
      if you're using instruments to control the airplane
    - *weather reports don't necessarily dictate whether you can log instrument time*
 - Instrument Time can be logged as either *simulated* or *actual*
    - **Simulated:** using a view limiting device like a hood or foggles
    - **Actual:** in the clouds, dark night, etc.
 - **when logging *actual* instrument time, it's a good idea to log the *reason* that you are logging it,**
   in case you're called upon to explain the actual instrument hours later on

**Logging Instrument Time for Recency of Experience Requirements**

 - when logging instrument time for recency of experience requirements, you're required to log:
    - the location and type of any instrument approach
    - name of the safety pilot (if applicable)
 - **if you're flying with foggles/hood in VMC, then you *need a safety pilot*** (remember, it's VMC
   so it's likely there will be other airplanes flying around that ATC doesn't know about
 - **Safety Pilot Requirements:**
    - must have at least a private pilot license with category, class, and type rating (if necessary) for
      the aircraft used for the flight
    - must have adequate vision forward and to each side to scan for traffic
    - must have a current third class medical
       - they are considered a 'required crewmember'
 - a safety pilot **can log this time as PIC** if they agree to (and is qualified to) act as the *legal PIC*
   for this flight
    - therefore, you *both* get to log PIC: the person flying is *acting PIC*, the safety pilot is *legal PIC*

# FAR 61.57 - Recency of Experience (PIC)

[FAR 61.51][far-61-57] - covers what's required to remain Instrument Current

 - to act as PIC under IFR, or fly in weather conditions less than VFR, then within the preceding
   six calendar months, have performed *and logged*:
    - six instrument approaches
    - holding procedures and tasks (entering the hold, etc.)
    - intercepting and tracking through the use of navigation systems
 - these must have been completed in flight, in actual or simulated IMC
 - they must be in the same category of aircraft for which instrument priveleges are sought, *or*
 - a simulator or flight training device (FTD) that's representative of the category of aircraft you
   intend to fly

**Using an ATD for Instrument Currency**

The FARs are a little different for ATDs (note, these aren't full size 'simulators'):

 - must be within the preceding **two calendar months**
 - perform and log three hours of instrument experience
 - holding procedures and tasks
 - six instrument approaches
 - two unusual attitude recoveries while descending Vne
 - two unusual attitude recoveries while in an ascending stall condition
 - interception and tracking courses using electronic navigation systems
 - an instructor must be present (this last point is true for simulators and FTDs as well)

**Currency Examples**

 1. Today's date is July 15th
     - therefore, the *preceding* six calendar months are June, May, April, March, February, January
     - start from 1 January in your log book
     - scan through and see whether you have logged at least six approaches, and holding
     - if so, you can legally fly IFR
 2. Today's date is 1 January
     - the preceding six months are December, November, October, September, August, July
     - start from 1 July and count the approaches and holds logged

**Lapsed Currency**

 - if you are not IFR current, then you can take a safety pilot with you and log the number of
   approaches and/or holds under **simulated IFR**, then log them
 - how long are you current for at that point? Well, it depends on which month the *oldest* logged
   approach or hold was in. Therefore, it might be a good idea to do the full six approaches and
   hold when getting current so you have the longest time available before the requirements are
   due again (this depends on how much you intend to file IFR in the next six months, if you're filing
   frequently then you're constantly updating your requirements)
 - **how long do you have to get current again?**
    - six months beyond when the currency lapsed to get current again with a safety pilot
    - after six months, you're required to take an **Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC)** with an
      authorized instructor

**Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC)**

 - must be given in an aircraft of the same category as the one in which you wish to act as PIC, *or*
 - in a flight simulator or FTD representative of that category of airplane
 - consists of a 'representative number of tasks required by the instrument rating PTS'
 - can be given by a CFII or a DPE authorized to give IR practical tests

# FAR 61.133 - Commercial Pilot Priveleges and Limitations

 - [FAR 61.133][far-61-133] - covers what a person holding a CPL is allowed to do
 - if you have a CPL and *no* IR, you have a limitation placed on the CPL certificate that states *"The
   carriage of passengers for hire in airplanes on cross-country flights in excess of 50 nautical miles
   or at night is prohibited.*
 - the instrument rating required to remove this limitation must be in the same category of aircraft
