# Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)

 - GPS is accurate enough for lateral IFR navigation, but it's not so precise for vertical navigation
 - **WAAS is a system that improves GPS accuracy dramatically**, in both vertical and horizontal dimensions
 - **Accuracy with WAAS**:
    - laterally: 3-6' (1-2 meters)
    - 2-3 meters vertically (why is this experessed in meters only...?)

**Components of the WAAS** (at this time)

 - 25x precisely surveyed Wide Area Ground Reference Stations **(WRS)**
 - 2x Wide Area Master Ground-Based Stations **(WMS)**
 - 2x geosynchronous communications satellites **(GEO)**
 - 2x transponder satellites **(?)**

The 25 WRSs receive GPS signals from the regular GPS satellites and look for signal errors. Since they've been
precisely surveyed, any GPS error can be immediately detected. This correction is then sent to your GPS unit.
More details:

 - the 25 ground-based (WRS) stations send their information to the WMS (master ground-based station)
 - here, corrections are applied to determine the GPS error for a *particular part of the country*
 - the correction message is uplinked to one of the two geosynchronous communications satellites (GEO)
 - the GEO satellite broadcasts the correction on a specific GPS frequency, which can be picked up by anyone
   with a WAAS-capable receiver

**LNAV vs VNAV**

 - *without* WAAS, you can still fly GPS approaches
    - when you do, you're using what is properly called **lateral navigation (LNAV)**
 - *with* a WAAS-capable IFR certified GPS receiver, you now have the capability of generating a glideslope
   - this allows you to fly something known as **approaches with approved vertical guidance**
   - these would be **LNAV/VNAV** (also known as L/VNAV), or **LPV-type** approaches
   - **LPV** stands for **Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance**
   - collectively, WAAS-capable GPS units allow you to fly an **Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV)**

# RNAV Chart Minimums Section

*This will be based on the NACO RNAV (GPS) Runway 24 Approach to Carlsbad, CA (KCRQ).*

 - **LNAV MDA**: this is the MDA for lateral navigation. In other words, a normal non-precision GPS approach
 - **APV minima**: this covers LNAV/VNAV, and LPV
    - minimums for these approaches work the same as a DA for an ILS
    - the glideslope angle is shown in the profile view (eg. 3.20 degrees)
    - the threshold crossing height **(TCH)** is also shown in the profile view, under the glideslope angle
      (eg. TCH 52)
 - keep in mind that when flying to LNAV/VNAV minimums, you *may not level off at the DA** and continue flying,
   the **DA is the point where you must make a decision whether to land or execute a missed approach**

On this approach chart, we notice that the LNAV/VNAV DA is actually 140' *higher* than the LNAV MDA, which
intially doesn't make much sense - the precision approach is intended to get you lower, right? The answer lies
in *Baro-VNAV*.

# Barometric Vertical Navigation (Baro-VNAV)

*This is a bit of a segue, we'll carry on with WAAS minimums in the next section "LPV DA".*
To fly the glideslope of an LNAV/VNAV approach *without* a WAAS-capable GPS receiver, you'd need an airplane
with Baro-VNAV capability.

 - Baro-VNAV is a nav system with a computer that provides vertical guidance *between two waypoints* (or a
   descending angle from a single waypoint) **based on barometric altitude**
 - it's measured by a special barometric altimeter in your airplane
 - if this is the first time you've heard of it, your airplane probably doesn't have it. It's normally found
   in larger corporate aircraft, or combined with fancy airline FMSes
 - the issue is that because Baro-VNAV uses an altimeter, it's affected by extreme temperatures
    - **therefore, higher LNAV/VNAV minimums may be as a result of compensation for expected temperature errors**
    - the specs for LNAV/VNAV were also written pre-WAAS, so they therefore require stricter obstacle clearance

# LPV DA

 - on the other hand, there are minimums that offer near ILS performance, such as LPV
 - LPV stands for **Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance**
 - LPV minimums **require that you have WAAS-capable GPS** in your airplane
    - to be clear, *any computer-generated glideslope requires WAAS* (except for Baro-VNAV)
 - if you were cleared for this approach, and your **WAAS receiver indicated that LPV minimums were allowed**
   (more on this later), then you could descend to a DA of 700'

# LNAV+V

 - this is an additional type of WAAS software-generated glideslope that you may encouter
 - LNAV+V stands for an **LNAV approach with Advisory Vertical Guidance**
 - this is essentially a **non-precision approach**with an advisory glideslope (+V) that provides vertical
   guidance so you don't have to worry about things like stepdown fixes
    - you fly the glideslope down to an MDA (note: not a DA) and level off, trying to get the required airport
      pieces in sight
 - because the glideslope is advisory, you can ignore it and just descend to the stepdown fixes
 - "LNAV+V" isn't in the minimums section of an approach chart, since these don't represent minimumsA
 - however, on your GPS unit you should see the leters "LNAV+V" indicating that an advisory glideslope is
   available

# WSR Availability Marked on Approach Charts

 - a **white 'W' in a black square in the second briefing area**
 - indicates that WAAS vertical guidance may not be available all the time at this location
 - you should plan (either as a destination or alternate) on using the *LNAV minima*
 - we'll look at how to tell which glideslope - if any - are available

# Flying the Approach to APV Minimums

*This is based on the RNAV (GPS) Z RWY 31 at KSLE.*

 - we're a mile south of GLORR, GPS is in terminal mode because we're within 30NM of the airport
 - as we pass over GLORR the IF, NECIP, becomes the active waypoint
 - during this, our GPS unit is evaluating its horizontal and vertical accuracy
 - the WAAS unit is designed to allow the lowest minimums provided based on meeting the required
   **Horizontal Position Limits (HPL)** and **Vertical Position Limits (VPL)**
 - in most cases you know which minimums are available when reaching the IF
    - at this point the approach mode annunciator will indicate the letters for the lowest minimums allowed

**TL;DR**: the GPS unit will tell you which minimums to use, probably at the IF

**Remember: RNAV (GPS) glideslopes take you to a point approximately *1,000' past the threshold***

# LP Approaches

 - LP stands for **Localizer Performance**, but with *no* vertical guidance
 - the difference between this and an LNAV approach is that an **LP is a WAAS approach** (more accurate)
 - it's flown the same way, but may have different minimums, shown as 'LP' in the minimums section
 - because it's more precise, the **protected area is much smaller** than found on an LNAV course

# WAAS Protected Horizontal Limits

 - between the IF and FAF, **starts at 1NM**, then gradually decreases to **2 degrees** (all either side of
   the centerline
 - this transition from a fixed to angular scale is what makes it 'localizer like', and where the term
   "Localizer Performance" comes from
 - **at the FAF**, your CDI scaling starts somewhere near +/- .3NM, and reduces to a CDI scale of **+/- 350'**
   (for a 5 dot deflection, each dot = 70' displacement) at the MAWP (Missed Approach Waypoint)
 - it continues at +/- 350' until a missed approach is initiated
 - keep in mind, some GPS units show their own displacement dots, but there may not be 5 of them
    - in this case, the *full scale deflection* is still constant, ie. +/- 350'
    - so if there are only two dots, then each dot is a displacement of +/- 175' (350/2)

# Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)

 - this is a special program built into the GPS unit to warn you when there's a navigational accuracy or
   reliability problem
 - *keep in mind (actually, we haven't covered this yet..) that when using a WAAS GPS unit and when WAAS
   NOTAMs don't suggest a WAAS signal outage, then a RAIM check isn't necessary for IFR flight*
 - RAIM vertifies two important items:
    1. the signals from satellites aren't providing corrupted information
    2. a sufficient number of satellites are being received to check for any transmission errors (also called
       **'Adequate Satellite Geometry'**
 - there are generally two error messages (which vary by unit), but correspond to the above issues:
   1. alerts that the RAIM integrity monitor has detected a potential error that exceeds the limit for the
      current phase of flight
   2. alerts that there aren't enough satellites visible to your GPS receiver to provide RAIM integrity
      monitoring
 - **if you get a RAIM alert message, you can't fly an instrument approach for the duration of the alert**

**RAIM Limits**

 - to preform proper RAIM, your GPS unit must be able to spot at least one satellite *in addition* to the
   minimum of **four required for normal nav**
    - *four total is ok if your GPS accepts non-satellite information, such as manually entering the current
      altimeter setting*
 - GPS units have a RAIM page where you can enter your destination and ETA, and determine whether RAIM
   will be available to fly a non-precision approach
    - this prediction applies to a time +/- 15 minutes from your ETA
    - if you *don't* have RAIM, you'll have to fly the approach some other way
    - you can also do the same with a FSS
 - on the other hand, if you have **WAAS**, you want to check **WAAS NOTAMs for *System Status* and
   *Level of Service* at the destination (and departure) airports
    - the level of service identifies which type of minimums you can expect at the airport
    - if there *is* a WAAS NOTAM, but your GPS still indicates LPV is available, then you **can fly to LPV
      minimums**

**Active monitoring of an alternate means of navigation (eg. VOR) is *required* when the RAIM capability
of the GPS unit is lost. It is *not* required if your GPS uses and has RAIM.**

**Using the term 'RAIM'**

 - it's important to note that the term RAIM is used in a number of different ways
    - "I don't have RAIM" - means that there weren't a sufficient number of satellites available to fly a
      GPS approach
    - "I received a RAIM alert" - they received a message indicating satellite signal corruption or availability
      problems
