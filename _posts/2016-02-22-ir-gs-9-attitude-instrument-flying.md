# The 3 Fundamental Skills of Attitude Instrument Flying

 1. Instrument Cross Check
 2. Instrument Interpretation
 3. Aircraft Control


# 1. Instrument Cross Check (the 'scan')

**Definition:**

> the continuous and logical ovservation of instruments for attitude and performance information

 - necessary because no one instrument has all information
 - also helps identify when an instrument is faulty

**Fixation**

 - fixation is caused by concentrating on a particular instrument to the exclusion of others
 - in general (there's an exception) fixation and scanning are opposites
 - another kind of fixation occurs when **checking an instrument that doesn't need scanning**
   - eg. making a 180 degree turn, roll in to a standard rate turn to the right. The turn will take 60 seconds (180 deg @ 3 deg/sec = 60 seconds). The heading indicator isn't needed for most of this maneuver, so including it in the scan for the first 50 seconds of the turn is unnecessary - you only want to check it at the end of the turn to roll out on the correct heading. This is a type of fixation.

**Omission**

 - not including an instrument in the scan that should be
   - eg. rolling out of 180 degree turn using the attitude indicator. The attitude indicator may have a slight precession error which requires cross checking against the heading indicator to verify the turn is completed at the correct heading.


# 2. Instrument Interpretation

 - using all available information to interpret the current situation
   - eg. a 10 degree nose up pitch attitude on the attitude indicator could indicate either a climb, slow flight at a constant altitude, or a descent in a stall. Other instruments (VSI, altimeter, airspeed, RPM/manifold pressure) need to be cross checked in order to determine what's really happening.


# 3. Aircraft (airplane) Control

 - selecting a specific power setting and attitude for the performance you want (remember attitude is pitch and bank)

**Pitch Control**

 - using the elevators to rotate the airplane about its lateral axis
 - pitch instruments:
   - attitude indicator (AI)
   - altimeter (alt)
   - airspeed indicator (ASI)
   - vertical speed indicator (VSI)
 - interpretation of all these instruments provides a good understanding of what the airplane's doing

**Bank Control**

 - using ailerons to alter the angle the airplane's wings make with the horizon
 - bank instruments:
   - attitude indicator (AI)
   - heading indicator (HI)
   - turn coordinator (TC)
   - magnetic compass

**Power Control**

 - power control instruments:
   - tachometer (RPM)
   - manifold pressure (MP)
   - airspeed indicator (ASI)
 - RPM/MP are more obvious, but the ASI is often the most useful. For example, to achieve an airspeed in straight-and-level flight the primary instrument is the ASI (and then checking RPM/MP to verify they're not red-lined)
