# Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) Chart Format

 - the TAA format is similar to the Standard T, but **normally includes a holding pattern for course reversal**
 - just like a non-GPS chart, the holding pattern begins at the fix (or 'waypoint' for GPS) where the IAF begins
    - the T configuration usually has an IAF at its top center position - a total of 3 IAFs on the upper portion
      of the T formation
 - it's ideal for RNAV (GPS) approaches because it provides for arrivals from all directions without need for
   radar vectors (although you may still get radar vectors when using a TAA chart)

**Areas in a TAA chart**

The TAA chart has three areas, which based on a partial circle created by drawing a 30NM arc from the
corresponding IAF:

 1. straight in area
 2. left base area
 3. right base area

 - these are shown on the chart with details about which fixes make up these *lateral* boundaries
 - if you are in any of those areas, ATC can clear you for the approach via the specific intersection identifying
   these areas

**Minimum Altitudes**

 - each lateral area has an associated *TAA Minimum Altitude*
 - the TAA Minimum Altitude is printed on the chart within the section describing the lateral boundaries
 - when you're within the boundaries *and ATC clears you for the approach*, you would descend to this
   minimum altitude unless otherwise instructed, proceed to the IAF, and fly the approach

**When to use the Holding Pattern for Course Reversal on a TAA Chart**

*Note: this all seems a bit vague, except for point 1. May need some clarification.*

 - if the controller says **'straight in'**, *don't* perform a course reversal
 - otherwise, perform the hold
    - if it's a turn greater than 90 degrees to the final approach course, then you *can't* be cleared to that
      fix *unless* you're allowed to perform the course reversal
    - if it's a turn of less than 90 degrees to the final approach course, then you still have to perform the
      procedure turn unless you've been told 'straight in'
 - **the chart will generally give guidance on when a NoPT is required**
    - remember, this means you *aren't allowed to fly a PT unless specifically authorized*

**Example Clearance**

*"2132 Bravo, cleared to OVMAF. Maintain 7,000 feet until entering the TAA. Cleared RNAV Runway 12 approach."*

 - in this case, because you haven't yet entered the TAA's lateral boundaries (we're assuming the airplane is
   more than 30NM from the OVMAF waypoint), then you maintain 7,000'
 - once you're within the 30NM radius from OVMAF, you may descend to the minimum altitude for this TAA area, which
   is 5,500' (chart is RNAV (GPS) RWY 12, KSMX)
 - upon reaching OVMAF, continue to fly the approach as published

**Additional Notes about the *Straight In* Area**

 - the straight-in area may have additional divisions in the form of pie shaped sectors, or it may have stepdown
   sections based on lesser arcs from the centered fix
 - *example: between 30NM and 6NM to WINCH, the TAA minimum altitude may be 5,500', but within 6NM the TAA Mininmum
   Altitude is lowered to 3,300'*

**(Lack of..) MSAs in TAA Charts**

 - Terminal Approach Charts don't include MSAs, because the TAA Mininmum Altitudes serve this purpose instead
 - unlike MSAs, **TAAs are *flyable* altitudes**, providing 1,000' of obstacle clearance, or 2,000' in mountainous
   areas
 - they also provide navigation and communication capability
 - it's also worth noting that the distances of the two side IAFs from the center IAF are chosen to accommodate
   the size and performance of aircraft most likely to use that airport
    - typically these are 3 to 6 NM
