# Essential Glideslope Details

 - at the bottom right-hand corner of an ILS chart, you see the **glideslope angle** and the **Threshold Crossing Height (TCH)**
 - keep in mind that this is the height of the *glideslope antenna*, in a small plane taht doesn't matter much, but the difference between the pilot and antenna locations in a large jet could be substantial - this is why it's essential to know the TCH
 - in the profile view, below the grey sloping glideslope, the **lateral distance** from components of the ILS approach (eg. LOM, MM) to the runway threshold are shown
 - if the chart includes a LOC approach as well as an ILS, the LOC minimums will be published
   - in this case, you descend to the *MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude)*, not the DA (Decision Altitude)
 - remember, if flying the LOC or any other non-precision approach, the FAF (for FAF to MAP distances and timings) is denoted in the profile views by the *Maltese Cross*

**Final Approach Fixes in Precision and Non-Precision Approaches**

 - **Precision:**
   - in a *precision approach*, the FAF is called the **PFAF**, or *Precision Final Approach Fix*
   - this is the point where you *intercept the glideslope and begin your final descent for landing*
 - **Non-Precision:**
   - the FAF is always located where you find the Maltese Cross in the profile view
   - this is the fix where you begin your final descent to the MDAs shown in the minimums section

*In either case, start your stopwatch when crossing the FAF so you're able to identify the MAP using the time/distance table shown on the chart.*

# The Six Ts

The 'Six Ts' is a memory aid *used when flying an instrument approach or holding pattern*.

They are: **Time, Turn, Twist, Throttle, Talk, Track**

 - **Time:** start the stopwatch or note the time when crossing over the fix (holds) or FAF (approach)
 - **Turn:** applies to holds more than approaches, turn to the outbound heading of the hold
 - **Twist:** again, more for holds - twist the OBS to the new heading as a reminder
 - **Throttle:** reduce or increase throttle as necessary (more for approaches, descending to MDA at the FAF)
 - **Talk:** reporting to the tower/traffic that you're inbound, or giving ATC the required position report in a hold
 - **Track:** track either the hold's outbound course, or the localizer on the approach

Although not all tasks apply in both situations, it's a good idea to run through the complete list as a method of habit.

# Making an Early Missed Approach

 - the missed approach area consists of an upwardly sloped plane that ascends uniformly at the rate of 40:1 (40' horizontally for every 1' up)
 - it begins at the MAP, and extends 15 miles for a straight out missed approach
 - when the missed approach is initiated, you're expected to climb **at least 200' per Nautical Mile**
   - at 120 KTS ground speed (2 miles/minute), you must maintain a climb of at least **400FPM**
 - the altitude protection you start with is based on being at the MDA at the MAP

If you make a missed approach on an ILS prior to reaching DA, or on a non-precision approach before reaching MDA:

 - **begin a climb and proceed to the point where the missed approach would normally begin before making any turns**
   - for an ILS approach, you can use either the the Middle Marker (usually approximately where the DA is), or use the timed MAP from the non-precision approach if it's available

**It's important to proceed to the MAP before beginning any turns** - otherwise you may be cutting the corner and flying through uncharted space.

# Using Non-Precision Minimums on an ILS

If you've been cleared for the ILS, but want to fly the non-precision portion of this approach, then you can track the localizer and descend to the MDA as published on the chart.

In this case, you would tell the controller you want to fly the ILS, but use non-precision mininmums

A good example of this is **circling to land on an ILS**. If a controller clears you for the ILS, but tells you 'circle to land north of the airport on 25 right', this is no longer a precision approach (because you're no longer flying the glideslope). In this case, use the circle to land MDA as published.

# Circling to Land

 - when circling to land, when should you leave the MDA?
   - the text advises to *wait until you're aligned (or nearly so) with the runway* and have identified a good VASI signal, if one exists
 - **if you lose sight of the airport while circling to land** you should fly the missed approach prcoedure as shown on the chart
   - this may be a little tricky if you've turned around, eg. to enter a downwind or base leg
   - in this case, remember to **turn toward the landing runway and begin a climb to 800'** as discussed before. Upon reaching 800', follow the rest of the missed approach instructions
 - it's important to know what you'll do in the case of a missed approach *before* the time to do it arrives

# Inoperative Components

 - the Inoperative Component Table is found in the beginning of the NACO chart booklet
 - it outlines what happens in the case that a piece or pieces of the landing system are inop
   - *example: ALSF 1&2, MALSR, & SSALR, with Category ABCD approach, Increase Visibility by 1/4 mile*
 - this table has multiple sections for each type of approach (ILS, ILS w/ > 1,800' RVR, VOR, etc.) you need to check the approach to see which applies
 - **if multiple components are inop**, use the *largest* visibility increase of any components
