# ILS Approach with a Teardrop Procedure Turn

For any direct references, we'll be using the ILS Runway 32 approach to Dothan Regaional (KDHN).

 - this approach includes a courses reversal made up of a *teardrop*
 - if a teardrop prcoedure turn is published, it must be done exactly as shown
   - the obstacle protection for a teardrop reversal is much smaller than 45-180 barb-type course reversal

**Teardrop Procedure Turn**

 - some charts use a teardrop turn instead of a hold or 45-180 barb turn
 - they seem pretty straight forward, the heading to fly is printed on the flyable route on the plan view, altitude restrictions on the profile view
 - often (always?) include a restriction of how far the turn must be within the navaid
   - *example: "Teardrop left turn within 10 NM of VORTAC"*
   - this can either be determined using DME, or by timing (eg. 120 kts ground speed = 2 miles/min = 5 mins)

# DME Arc Transitions

 - note that DME for a DME arc transition *doesn't come from the localizer* - the localizer can only transmit along its single course
 - altitude restrictions for DME arcs **are often higher** than the airway or other route that they originate from, it's really important to check the minimum altitude for the DME arc as shown on the chart

**Lead Radial**

 - as you continue to circle on the DME arc, you'll eventually reach something called a *Lead Radial (LR)*
   - when you cross this LR, you're close enough to the localizer course that you should begin a *standard rate turn to intercept and track the localizer*

**Where to Intercept the Arc**

 - you can *only intercept a DME arc from an IAF*
 - if you were to cross the arc (eg. on vectors) when cleared for the approach, you **can not turn on to the arc unless at an IAF**
 - in some cases, it may require you to fly to the navaid the arc is based off, then find an airway or other flyable route that leads to the IAF at the end of the arc
 - *don't ask ATC for vectors on to the arc*, they can't legally do that - they could give you a different clearance though (eg. teardrop instead)

# Localizer Directional Aid (LDA) Approach

 - essentially a localizer similar to the localizer for an ILS (still *3 to 6 degrees wide*)
 - differs primarily in **not being perfectly aligned with the approach runway**, which is why it's called a Localizer 'Directional Aid'
   - *example: the Roanoke's LDA Runway 6 approach is about 10 degrees misaligned with the runway*
 - these may or may not include a glideslope (often not)
 - they usually include more restrictions, shown in the middle briefing area
 - Localizers *can* have DMEs, and often do, in which case they're often useful for identifying fixes on the approach
 - one of the most important parts about an LDA approach is to *expect the runway not to be aligned with the approach*, make sure you're looking out the correct side of the airplane to visually identify the runway

**Stepdown Fix**

 - this is a fix *inside the FAF*, there can be only one (if any at all)
 - especially useful if the FAF is far from the MAP
 - it exists to give you a fix to identify which allows you to descend to a lower altitude, it's not a marker beacon etc.
 - may be identified by DME, time, or ILS approved GPS
