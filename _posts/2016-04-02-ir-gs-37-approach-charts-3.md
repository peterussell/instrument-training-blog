# "No Procedure Turn" (NoPT)

 - some feeder routes (or other routes) don't require you to perform the procedure turn to get lined up with the inbound approach course
 - in this case, the route will be labled with **'NoPT'**, meaning that if flying inbound on that route, you **must not do** the procedure turn

# Using Procedure Turns to Lose Altitude

 - for example, if you arrived at an intersection at a high altitude and couldn't lose altitude as quickly as needed to descend to the posted minimums, **it's permissible to ask ATC for permission to do a Procedure Turn**
 - in this case, you're probably coming from a direction that doesn't require a procedure turn (ie. you'll need to turn around in order to get to the procedure turn)
   - because you need to *make a turn* back to get to the procedure turn, make sure that you **turn toward to the side of the barb** which depicts the side of the course to perform the procedure turn on
   - I'm assuming the same applies for a hold, although it probably makes sense just to do a direct/teardrop entry to the hold. Requires further investigation.

**Remember, if the chart says NoPT but you want to perform one, you *absolutely must ask for permission from ATC.***

# Minimum Sector/Safe Altitudes (MSAs)

 - provides a **1,000' clearance** for a **radius of 25NM** (25NM is printed on the chart) from the facility shown in the center of the MSA symbol
 - **does not guarantee navigation or communication capability**
 - gives general idea of the minimum safe altitude above terrain and obstacles in the case of an emergency, eg. lost comms while picking up ice, requiring an immediate descent
 - a TERPs specialist analyzes the terrain and divides it into sectors, **sectors are no larger than 90 degrees**
 - the MSA has nothing to do with approach/departure controller's **Minimum Vectoring Altitude** (MVA), or Center's **Minimum Instrument Altitude** (MIA)
   - controllers have a much more detailed map, and as a result MVAs and MIAs can be much lower than MSAs

**GPS Approaches and MSA:**

 - GPS approaches don't offer sectors, instead they provide an overall Minimum **Safe** Altitude (still an MSA)

# Missed Approach Point (MAP)

 - this is the point where the **inbound approach course to the runway (or airport) officially ends**
   - the point where, if we don't have the required visibility and runway environment in sight, we need to make a Missed Approach
 - before we can established the MAP, we need to figure out how to identify the FAF

**The Final Approach Fix (FAF)**

 - identified by the **Maltese cross**
 - after this point, the MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude) applies, which is found in the minimums section of the approach chart
 - the FAF is **the place from which we officially measure the distance to the MAP**

**Identifying the MAP**

 - there are multiple ways to identify the MAP, such as a VOR indication (TO/FROM flip), DME, NDB passage, arrival at DA, or timing along the approach course
 - the main idea is that there's always a definitive, unambiguous way of identifying when to execute a missed approach

# Airport Sketches and Time/Distance Tables

 - Time/Distance tables are shown *below the airport sketch box*
 - the **Airport Sketch** provides:
   - a picture of the airport layout
   - data and symbols to help identify runways
   - runway lengths, slope, displaced thresholds
   - pictures of approach and runway lighting
   - *most importantly*, it shows the position of the navaid relative to the runway (eg. VOR to the side) with an arrow-tipped black line leading to the navaid, this represents the position of your actual approach course relative to the position of the runway
 - the **Time/Distance Table**:
   - on approaches that use time from the FAF to identify the MAP, you'll find that time listed here
   - the time is listed for different airspeeds
   - **if no time values are listed**, this indicates that identification of the MAP is by a method other than by measuring time from the FAF
