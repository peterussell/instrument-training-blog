# Circulation in Highs and Lows

 - air should flow directly from high to low because of the **pressure gradient
   force**, which is the basic pushing force that acts on air causing it to
   move from high to low pressure areas
 - however, because of the **Coriolis force**:
    - descending high pressure air *spreads out* and moves in a **clockwise
      direction**
    - ascending low pressure air is converging on the center of the low pressure
      area, it's also turned to it's right (remember, it's coming *toward* the
      center, not *away* from it as in the case of descending high pressure air),
      therefore resulting in a **counterclockwise direction**
 - because of these two forces - *pressure gradient* and *Coriolis force* -
   **air pressure around a high or low flows *parallel to the isobars* instead
   of across them**
 - **surface friction** also has an effect on air within 2,000' of the surface:
    - it has a tendency to *decrease* wind speed as the wind gets pulled on
      by mountains, trees, etc.
    - because of this it also reduces the effect of the Coriolis force, means
      it's displaces less agreesively to the right
    - the result is that air within 2,000' of the surface won't have as much of
      a right twist on it when compared to winds above 2,000', and because those
      winds are *parallel to the isobars*, these surface winds will actually be
      curved a few degrees to the left of parallel to the isobar lines
    - **over water**, where there's less surface friction, wind curves left of
      the isobars by 10 to 15 degrees
    - **over land**, where there's more surface friction, wind can curve left of
      the isobars by 25 to 45 degrees left of the isobars
 - *surface friction explains why weather maps depicting winds at high altitudes
   (> 2,000') show different isobars than maps for those below
 - **the main thing to note is that because of all this, surface winds can
   sometimes give false indications of what the winds aloft are doing**
    - in cases where the wind is calm on the surface and wind at higher altitudes
      is moving quickly, you should be wary of wind shear

# Taking Advantage of High Altitude Winds

On long cross country flights, you can take advantage of high altitude winds around
highs and lows to get a tailwind and avoid a headwind:

 - for a **high pressure system (clockwise wind direction)**
    - W to E: fly *north*
    - E to W: fly *south*
 - for a **low pressure system (counterclockwise wind direction)**
    - W to E: fly *south*
    - E to W: fly *north*

This is called **pressure pattern flying.**

You can tell whether you're approaching a high or a low based on the relationship
between wind correction angle and ground track:

 - when approaching a **high**, you will always make a wind correction
   angle to the **right**
 - when approaching a **low**, you will always make a wind correction angle to
   the **left**

# Divergence / Convergence

 - when high pressure air descends toward the ground, once it gets to the ground
   it can't go any further and so has to spread out
    - this is called **divergence**
 - when low pressure air ascends toward the low pressure center, once it reaches
   the center it has nowhere further it can go, so it ascends
    - this is called **convergence**
    - you can think of convergence like an ice skater bringing in their limbs
      to speed up a spin, the same thing happens around a low, which is why
      **wind speeds in a low are generally stronger than in a high pressure area**

# Isobars and Wind Speeds

 - closely spaced isobars means a rapid pressure change, further spaced isobars
   indicate a slower pressure change
    - where there's a faster pressure change you can expect high winds (the
      air is rapidly trying to get from one place to another)

**Spacing of isobars is a good indication of wind strength in that area.**

 - weak pressure gradients (areas where there isn't much pressure change) are
   shown by **dashed lines**
    - you can expect light winds in these areas

# Weather Associated with Highs and Lows

In addition to wind direction and speed, highs and lows also have their own
weather associated with them:

 - as high pressure air descends, it warms up, decreasing the relative humidity,
   clouds are less likely to form with decreasing humidity, and clouds that are
   present are likely to dissipate
 - therefore, **highs are generally associated with clear skies**
 - lows, on the other hand, have rising air that expands and cools - if it
   approaches its dewpoint the condensation occurs and clouds form, and the
   weather usually gets worse
 - therefore, **lows are generally associated with murky, cloudy, crappy skies**

A rule to help remember is the **Rule of L: low = left (counterclockwise) = lousy.
