# FAR 91.3 - Responsibility and Authority of the PIC

 - [FAR 91.3][far-91-3]
 - gives any pilot the same authority as the PIC of their airplane
 - states that you, the PIC, are **directly responsible for, and are the final authority as to the operation
   of the aircraft**
 - one of the most important powers conveyed by this rule is the ability to declare an emergency
    - *example: you may be experiencing icing and need ATC to make room for you in the approach queue*
 - stating "I'm declaring an emergency" puts all available resources at your beck and call, and gives you
   priority over *everything*
 - if the emergency requires immediate action, this regulation allows you to **deviate from any rule to
   the extent required to meet the emergency**
 - there are other aspects of the flight that the PIC is responsible for, eg. verifying equipment
   requirements are met, maintenance checks have been done for aircraft that are used for IFR
    - the PIC is always held responsible for determining that *all equipment is present and all required
      checks and maintenance have taken place before your flight*

# FAR 91.21 - Portable Electronic Devices

 - [FAR 91.21][far-91-21]
 - the probition against operation of protable electronic devices pertains to air carrier aircraft, **and
   any other aircraft being operated under IFR**
 - this prohibition doesn't apply to any devices the operator determines do not interfere with the
   navigation or communication systems of the aircraft
 - it's actually the FCC (not the FAA) that bans cellphones when airborne
 - as of this writing (of the textbook), the FAA has not published any information or guidance for
   pilots regarding the effect, if any, that cellphones have on the comm or nav systems

# FAR 91.103 - Preflight Action

 - [FAR 91.103][far-91-103]
 - the rules say that as PIC you should become familiar with *all* information conerning that flight
 - more specifically, for flights under IFR or not in the vicinity of the airport (> 5 miles), there are
   some mandatory checks:
    - weather reports and forecasts
    - fuel requirements
    - alternatives available (1-2-3 rule (1 hour before/after, 2,000' ceiling, 3 miles vis)
    - any known traffic delays of which the PIC has been advised by ATC
 - some specific items for *any* flights
    - runway lengths and takeoff and landing data for the airplane
    - NOTAMS
    - airspace boundaries and requirements (eg. Bravo, Charlie, Restricted, Prohibited etc.)
    - weather facilities and frequencies along the route
    - TFRs
 - keep in mind that a valid aviation weather briefing (one that meets your legal requirements to receive
   a briefing before departing) can only be given by FSS or DUATS *(although I'm sure I read an article
   recently about how there's no such thing as an official weather briefing...)*
 - websites receiving the FAA stamp of approval can also provide valid briefings

# FAR 91.119 - Minimum Safe Altitudes: General

 - [FAR 91.119][far-91-119] - describes minimum safe altitude rules to protect people on the surface as well
   as people in the airplane
 - none of the rules apply to taking off or landing

 1. no person may operate an aircraft below an altitude allowing an emergency landing to be made without
    undue hazard to persons or property on the surface in the event of an engine failure
     - *essentially, give yourself a reasonable chance of gliding to a landing site at all times*
 2. when flying over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of
    persons, the aircraft must be operated at an altitude of **1,000' above the highest obstacle within
    a horizontal radius of 2,000'** of the aircraft
     - "congested area": a formal definition is lacking, but based on a few NTSB court decisions, it seems
       to be anywhere you reasonably expect a group (small or large) of people to be.
     - *example: one pilot was cited for operating less than 1,000' above a few isolated homes with smoke
       rising from the fireplaces. Smoke was the vital factor, since its presence implied that the homes
       were occupied*
     - *example 2: one pilot wasn't cited over a warehouse, for the reason that it was Sunday and the
       warehouse probably wasn't occupied*
     - therefore, the presence (expected or otherwise) of people appears to be the determining factor
 3. when operating an aircraft over **other than a congested area**, no person may operate below an
    altitude of **500' above the surface, except over water or sparsely populated areas**. In those
    cases, the aircraft **may not be operated within 500' of any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure**

# FAR 91.121 - Altimeter Settings

 - [FAR 91.121][far-91-121]
 - current and accurate altimeter settings are critical to safety, especially when flying on instruments
 - the FAR says that **when below 18,000' MSL, you must have an altimeter setting from a station along
   your route and within 100NM of your aircraft**
 - in IFR this isn't usually a problem, you'll get them at almost every handoff, but you want to be
   especially vigilant in rapidly changing weather - remember: "high to low, look out below"
 - the correct altimeter setting is vital for separation from terrain, obstacles, and other airplanes
 - when operating **at or above 18,000' MSL,** set the altimeter to 29.92"Hg
    - in short, you're flying pressure altitudes at or above 18,000' MSL
    - when you descend below 18,000' MSL, remember to set it back to the local altimeter setting

# FAR 91.123 - Compliance with ATC Clearance and Instructions

 - [FAR 91.123][far-91-123]
 - when an ATC clearance has been obtained, no PIC may deviate from that clearance unless:
    - an amended clearance has been obtained
    - an emergency exists
    - in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory
 - if you receive a clearance and are confused by it, you're required to request clarification
 - if you get a clearance you don't like and are in VMC (and expect it to stay that way), and you're
   not in Class A airspace, you can always cancel IFR and proceed on your own route
    - ATC will never offer to cancel an IFR clearance, you have to initiate it yourself
 - **if you deviate due to an emergency or traffic alert advisory,** you need to inform ATC of your
   deviation as soon as possible
    - ATC may also (but doesn't have to) ask that you submit a detailed report of the emergency to the
      manager of the facility that gave you priority within 48 hours

# FAR 91.126 - Operating On or In the Vicinity of an Airport in Class G Airspace

 - [FAR 91.126][far-91-126]
 - with only a few exceptions, airports in Class G and E airspace don't have control towers, therefore
   pilots (IFR and VFR) must follow specific procedures to prevent bumping into each other
 - if you're on an instrument approach into an uncontrolled airport and the weather is VFR, you *do not
   have right of way over VFR traffic*
    - ie. you still need to maneuver in a way as to see and avoid other traffic
    - there are several court cases establishing a precedent that makes a pilot flying a non-standard
      pattern (including a straight in instrument approach) liable if an accident occurs

# FAR 91.127 - Operating On or In the Vicinity of an Airport in Class E Airspace

 - [FAR 91.127][far-91-127]
 - for all practical purposes, this regulation is the same as FAR 91.126 for Class G airspace
 - the only significant difference is an FAR Part 93 departure requirement for noise abatement
    - it's good, and professional, to follow noise abatement procedures when possible

# FAR 91.129 - Operations in Class D Airspace

 - [FAR 91.129][far-91-129]
 - Class D airspace generally extends from the surface up to 2,500' above the airport elevation
 - its radius varies based on the instrument procedures for which the controlled airspace is established
    - the typical radius is a little less than 5NM
 - the **primary airport** (the one for which the airspace is designated) has a control tower
 - there may be other airports that happen to lie within the Class D, but these may or may not have towers
    - these secondary airports are referred to as **satellite** airports

**Required Equipment**

  - two way radio
  - a transponder is *not* required
  you can request permission from ATC to fly in or out of Class D without a radio, eg. a ferry flight
  - in this case, call ATC on the phone for instructions on arriving/departing without radio comms

**Arrivals or Through-Flight**

  - if you want to transition the airpsace or land at the primary airport, you must establish two-way
    radio comms with the ATC facility responsible for that Class D airspace, and maintain them while in
    the airspace
  - **"Establish Communication"**: any time ATC acknowledges your call sign
  - if the controller says "N2132B, stand by" then you've technically established communication and can
    enter the Class D airspace
  - if the controller says "Aircraft calling Crumbling Tower, stand by" then you have *not* established
    communication and must remain clear of the airspace
  - if the controller says "N2132B, remain clear of Class D airspace" then you have established comms,
    but you still need to remain clear of the airspace

 - **Departures**

  - if you're departing from the primary airport, you must establish and maintain two-way radio comms
    with ATC within Class D airspace
  - if you're departing from a **satellite** airport, you need to call the ATC facility for the primary
    airport as soon as practical after departing
  - if departing **from a satellite airport under IFR**, you'll do what your clearance tells you to do,
    which may or may not be contacting the primary airport's tower (it could be departure instead)
  - on the other hand, you may actually call the primary airport tower to receive your IFR clearance

**Communications Failure:**

  - a provision in this regulation exists to allow you to enter Class D airspace under VFR conditions
    with lost communications
     - fly to the airport
     - enter the traffic pattern
     - watch the tower for light gun signals
     - wait for a steady green light and land

**Minimum Altitudes**

 - the important part is that you must stay **at or above the glideslope** until a lower altitude is
   necessary for landing, when approaching to land on a runway served by a VASI

**Takeoff, Landing, Taxi Clearance**

 - no person may, at an airport with an operating control tower, operate an aircraft on a runway or
   taxiway, or take off or land an aircraft unless an appropriate clearance is given
 - if this clearance is to a runway via a taxi route which intersects a runway (closed, active, or inactive)
   then the controller must issue a clearance to cross that runway before proceeding
 - you must receieve a clearance to cross *each runway*
 - this also applies if you're told to follow another airplane

# FAR 91.130 - Operations in Class C Airspace

 - [FAR 91.130][far-91-130]
 - typically is made of two pieces:
    - inner circle, radius = 5NM, extends SFC to 4,000' above the airport elevation
    - outer circle, radius = 10NM, extends 1,200' above the airport elevation to 4,000' above the airport
 - typically associated with airports that handle larger, faster airplanes
 - regulations are essentially the same as for Class D airspace

**Equipment Requirements**

 - this is one of the only things that's different - you're required to have a two-way radio, **and
   an altitude reporting transponder** ([FAR 91.215][far-91-215])

# FAR 91.131 - Operations in Class B Airspace

 - [FAR 91.131][far-91-131]
 - typically extends up to 10,000' MSL and has horizontal dimensions of many miles
 - the airspace is larger because the primary airport handles many large and fast airplanes, and
   considerable IFR activity
 - looks like an inverted wedding cake
 - the large space allows fast jets to make long arrivals and departures to the primary airport while
   remaining within the protected airspace

**Operating Rules**

 - must comply with all the rules in [FAR 91.129][far-91-129] (Class D)
 - must obtain a **clearance from the ATC facility before you can enter**
    - if you have a clearance to enter, but then leave the airspace again, *you must obtain a new
      clearance to re-enter the airspace*

**Pilot Requirements**

 - hold at least a PPL, or
 - be a Student, Recreational, or Sport pilot who meet additional requirements (there are additional FARs)

**Equipment Requirements**

 - two-way radio
 - transponder with altitude encoding
 - for IFR operations: an operable VOR receiver or suitable RNAV system

# FAR 91.135 - Operations in Class A Airpsace

 - [FAR 91.135][far-91-135]
 - exists over the lower 48 states and Alaska, and overlies the water within 12NM of the coast
 - extends from 18,000' MSL to 60,000' MSL
 - **must be on an IFR clearance** to operate in Class A airspace
 - altitudes ('flight levels' - all altimeters set to 29.92"Hg) in Class A airspace follow the East=odd
   West=even system

**Above Flight Level 290**

 - flights above FL290 require aircraft are equipped with equipment to fly in **RVSM - Reduced
   Vertical Separation Minimums** airspace
 - to operate under RVSM, altimeters are made more sensitive, manuals must be written, crew trained, and
   FAA approval receieved
 - these flights are still separated by 1,000' intervals with east odd (FL290, 310, 330, etc.) and west
   even (FL300, 320, 340, etc.)
