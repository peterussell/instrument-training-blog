# Clouds and Atmospheric Stability

 - when air parcels move through **unstable air**, the movement is more **vertical** than horizontal
 - cloud formations tend to accumulate vertically, creating Cumulus clouds
 - as the clouds build, they eventually release their condensed water in the form of **intermittent,
   showery-type precipitation**
    - it's not unusual to see rain appear beneath a cumulus and, shortly after, disappear

**Cumulus Clouds**

The characteristics of cumulus clouds are:

 1. unstable air
 2. good visiblity
 3. showery type precipitation
 4. turbulent conditions

 - when an air parcel moves through **stable air**, the resulting motion is more **horizontal** than
   it is vertical
 - the parcel of air doesn't develop the temperature difference with its environment that encourages
   vertical motion
 - if an air parcel is given a shove up the side of a mountain, it can eventually cool enough to
   condense and form a cloud
    - then, when the parcel of air is given an opportunity, it sinks back down to is original level on
      the other side of the mountain
    - during this process, stratus, or horizontally stretched clouds develop

**Status Clouds**

The characteristics of stratus clouds are:

 1. stable air
 2. poor visibility
 3. drizzle type precipitation
 4. smooth flying conditions

# Cloud Families

There are four types of cloud families, high clouds, low clouds, middle clouds, and clouds with
extensive vertical development.

 1. **High Clouds**
  - are cirriform and include *cirrus**, **cirrocumulus**, and **cirrostratus**
  - almost entirely composed of ice crystals
  - base heights range from about 16,500' to 45,000' in the middle latitudes
 2. **Middle Clouds**
  - **altostratus**, **altocumulus**, and **nimbostratus**
  - primarily water, much of which may be supercooled (below 32 deg F but *not frozen* - **it will
    often freeze instantly if given something to freeze *on*, like an airplane**)
  - base heights range from about 6,500' to 23,000' in middle latitudes
 3. **Low Clouds**
  - **stratus**, *stratocumulus**, and **fair weather cumulus** cloud types
  - almost entirely water, but at times the water may be supercooled
  - low clouds at subfreezing temperatures can also contain snow and ice particles
  - base heights from surface to about 6,500' in middle latitudes
 4. **Clouds with Extensive Vertical Development**
   - **towering cumulus**, **cumulonimbus**
   - usually contain supercooled water above the freezing level
   - when a cumulus grows to great heights, the water in the upper part of the cloud freezes into
     ice crystals and forms a cumulonimbus cloud
   - base heights from 1,000' or less to above 10,000'

# Thunderstorms/Squall Lines

 - pilots understand that water in the atmosphere is the enemy - when the atmosphere contains lots
   of moisture there's a great potential for atmospheric mischief once lifting gets going
 - for example, the area around Texas has a great deal of water vapor in the air, the area around
   the Texas panhandle is called Tornado Alley becase some of the world's nastiest thunderstorms
   exist here
    - the Gulf of Mexico adds so much water vapor to the air that a fast-moving cold front from
      the north often provides enough lift to create squall lines (lines of thunderstorms) hundreds
      of miles long
    - in other words, the fast moving cold front acts like a snow plough, pushing up parcles of
      moist air that eventually become warmer than the atmosphere surrounding them

# Calculating Cloud Bases

 - the *dewpoint* lapse rate is approximately **1 deg F per 1000' gained**
 - couple this with the parcel of unsaturated air lapse rate cooling of **4.5 deg F per 1000' gained**,
   and you can see the difference is **4.4 deg F per 1000'**
 - when the temperature and dewpoint converge, this is where water vapor condenses and visible
   moisture (clouds) form
 - to get an *estimate* of the cloud bases: **(temp - dewpoint) / 4.4** (or / 2.5 if using deg C)
    - the answer gives you the height of cloud bases in thousands of feet
 - *note: this method of estimating is only reliable for **cumulus clouds**, since they're usually
   formed by lifting and subject to the effects of changing lapse rates*

# High and Low Pressure Areas

 - there's a constant attempt to equalize any pressure differentials in the atmospheric system
 - this constant motion is what helps create wind and weather
 - our atmosphere is composed of billions of air molecules - **each air molecule is affected by gravity**
    - at the earth's surface, air pushes down with a pressure of 14.7lbs for every square inch
    - at some areas, other forces (mechanical, eg. dark asphalt, water) may act on the parcel of
      air, either lifting it or pushing it down, resulting in a different pressure at the surface
 - recall that **cool, descending air at the Poles causes higher atmospheric pressure**, and that **warm,
   rising air at the equator causes less atmospheric pressure**
 - **main idea:** in the case of pressure, air moves from *high pressure to low pressure* - this is
   the reason we have wind

**Sea and Land Breeze Circulation**

 - sea breezes form because **land warms faster than water**
    - heating the land heats the air lying next to it, causing the air to rise and an area
      of low pressure to be created
    - because the sea is slower to heat, it has an area of relative higher pressure than air over the land
    - in the atmosphere's attempt to equalize this pressure, air moves from the high pressure
      area over the sea to the low pressure over land, creating a **sea breeze - remember, we talk about
      where the wind *comes from* - a sea breeze *comes from* the sea**
 - conversely, at sunset, the land cools faster than the water (which retains heat)
    - air over the land is now cooler, relatively, than the warmer air over the ocean
    - as a result we get a **land breeze**
 - **high and low pressure areas are always relative** - there could be a number of high pressure areas
   around an air parcel, which would make that air parcel a low pressure area

*A good way to remember which cools or heats faster is thinking about swimming in the ocean - it's always
freezing in the morning but can be quite warm in the evening after a hot day, whereas the tarmac next to
the beach cools down pretty quickly after the sun goes down.*

# Perspective

 - it's important to remember that high and low pressure areas are *large masses of air* - sometimes
   thousands of miles across
 - they descend and rise slowly, sometimes rates from hundreds to thousands of feet per day
 - *within* these slowly moving oceans of air, smaller air parcels move up and down, playing out
   any of the previously discussed stability scenarios

# Highs and Lows on Weather Maps

 - on weather maps, high and low pressure systems are represented by a series of **contour lines**
 - **high pressure centers**
    - cooler, denser masses of air
    - move down and out (think about them hitting the ground and spreading)
    - rotate clockwise
 - **low pressure centers**
    - typically warmer, less dense masses of air
    - moves air inward and upward
    - rotates counterclockwise

**Contour Lines (Isobars)**

 - the contour lines surrounding high and low pressure areas are called **isobars**
 - an **isobar is a line connecting areas of equal barometric pressure**
 - placed along each isobar is a pressure value, stated in *millibars (thousandths of a bar,
   which is an international unit of pressure)
