The real life lessons have begun! The TSA has approved me to begin instrument training. So far I've taken two instructional flights with the third scheduled tomorrow, if the weather holds up. The irony of having to find weather good enough to fly outside the clouds so that you can practice flying in them isn't lost.

At the end of my last lesson I asked my CFII, Randy, whether he could give me a scenario to have a crack at in my home flight sim. He recommended I try a flight from Hillsboro (KHIO) flying the [Farmington Six][f6] departure, navigate to the Newberg VOR/DME (UBG), fly a hold at the OZIER intersection, then the [ILS to runway 22][ils] at Mc Minnville (KMMV).

To be clear - we haven't covered any of this stuff in lessons yet, it's really an attempt to start getting used to reading IFR charts and have a bit of fun.

Despite not knowing what I was doing, here's what I came up with:

 1. Depart KHIO on runway 31L. Climbing left turn to 210. Minimum climb is 240' per NM to 600'. At 90 knots this is a climb rate of greater than 320 FPM;
 2. Intercept the 346 radial from the Newberg VOR/DME (fly 166 degree heading TO);
 3. From the Newberg VOR/DME (UBG), fly outbound on the 111 radial to the OZIER intersection, defined as 4.4DME from UBG on the 111 radial, or as the intersection of the UBG 111 radial and the Battleground (BTG) 185 radial;
 4. Make a left ~180 degree turn, to fly inbound on a heading of 218 for the hold starting at the OZIER intersection, right turns, 1 minute legs (this all may or may not be correct, they're words I've heard before and seemed to correlate with the chart);
 5. At this point, I have no idea how to fly a hold. I timed the standard rate turn for 1 minute (for a 180 degree turn), flew the leg for a minute, then made the turn back in. The shape looks surprisingly like I expect (in my naive state) it to;
 6. When back at OZIER, fly the ILS for runway 22 in to KMMV, heading 218;

I tried the flight twice. The first time I read the chart incorrectly and tried to fly a 346 heading to Newberg. The charts says 166 degrees, but it pointed to - in that case I'm used to correcting the amount by 180 degrees, but didn't realize this had already been done. It drove home the point that when you look at the chart it has to make *sense* (flying a heading of 346 would be going north, away from the airport I'm trying to get to).

The second flight went much more smoothly. Still a lot to work on, but nowhere near as scrappy as the first.

Prepar3d - the flight simulator I have at home - has a good post-flight analysis tool which shows you your ground track, altitude and a bunch of other information. One less-than-stellar feature is that it chops parts off the printout. For your viewing and comedic pleasure, here it is:

*(the airport you can't see at the top is KHIO, the departure, and the airport that's cut off at the bottom is KMMV, so the flight goes top to bottom)*

Still a long way to go, but I'm looking forward to tomorrow's lesson. I'm intending to do writeups of each lesson (although I've been slack so far) - and need to keep up the progress on the ground school work to get the written out of the way.

If any instrument rated pilots have feedback and/or constructive criticism I'd love to hear it.

But for now: sleep!
