# Mountain Waves

**Lenticular Clouds**

 - as wind, usually with a **velocity of 40 knots or more**, encounters a sufficiently large mountin,
   a wave pattern is induced in the once smooth-flowing (laminar) air
 - this pattern sets up a series of waves in the downwind direction, with valleys and peaks that
   remain stationary
 - given enough moisture in the stable air, condensation (from air cooling as it rises) occurs at the
   peaks of these waves
 - **directly over the mountain top**, a **pileus** or **cap** cloud occurs above the rough mountain
   surface
 - further downwind almond or lens-shaped clouds for at the wave crests, called **lenticular** clouds,
   also called **standing wave clouds**
 - when the air between cloud forming layers is too dry to produce clouds, lenticular clouds will form
   one above the other, and this formation can extend up into the stratosphere
 - it's typical for mountain waves to form **100 miles or more downstream of the mountain barrier**
 - violent turbulence can be found in the up and downdrafts associated with lenticular clouds

**Rotor Clouds**

 - directly under the lenticular clouds, a small **rotor cloud** can frequently be found below the mountain
   peak altitudes
 - rotor clouds result from the **frictional effects of the surface** and a **lifing action from the rising
   crest of air**
    - air velocity is slowed near the surface, yet flows faster at higher altitudes - this adds a rolling
      motion to tubes of air
    - think of the top of the tube moving freely and the bottom being stuck to the ground, but with a
      high speed wind blowing along the top of it - this is what forms the long rotor clouds
 - rotor clouds are often **long cigar-shaped clouds**
 - they also **contain severe turbulence**

**Turbulence Without Clouds**

 - any time that wind exists in excess of **25 knots at mountain top altitudes** it's reasonable to expect
   some degree of turbulence as well as up and downdraft hazards
 - sometimes the air may be too dry for clouds to form, but this (of course) doesn't mean there isn't
   turbulence in the air

**Approaching a Mountain Ridge**

 - approaching a mountain on the windward side (upwind side), you might find yourself climbing at several
   thousand feet per minute with power completely reduced
 - however, worse is approaching from the leeward side without sufficient altitude to clear the downdrafts
   and possible rotor turbulence
 - approaches to mountains with strong winds present should be made with caution, because the strong
   downdrafts can easily exceed the climb ability of a light airplane
 - one method of aapproaching a ride you're unsure about is to **approach it at a 45 degree angle**, if you
   encounter downdrafts that you need to get out of, you only need to make a 90 degree turn to fly away from
   the ridge

# Temperature Inversions and Wind Shear

 - temperature inversions are common on the surface during clear, calm nights with little or no surface
   winds
 - however strong winds can exist **just above the inversion** due to the different temperatures - warmer
   air on top tends to slide along the cooler air below
    - this wind speed can increase when the pressure differential is greater, causing high wind speeds
      in the warmer air aloft
 - **if winds move in excess of 25 knots at 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the surface, you should expect wind
   shear in the zone where the warm and cold air meet**
 - differences in wind velocities cause a tearing or churning of the air, producing eddies or turbulence
   in the shear zone
    - pilots climbing or descending at slow speeds might find the wind shear bad enough to induce a stall
      at altitudes close to the ground
    - this can be a significant problem if the inversion occurs within a few hundred feet of the ground

**A good warning for wind shear is if the winds at the ground are calm but the winds aloft (2,000 to 4,000'
or lower) are high, eg. in excess of 25 knots.** Indicators (with calm surface winds reported) are:

 a. a large crab angle to stay aligned with the runway
 b. a big difference between your indicated airspeed and ground speed

Wind shear occurs most commonly in the first few hours after sunset, where the air temperature is still warm
but the earth cools quickly - recall this means the air close to the earth is cooler than the air aloft
creating the temperature inversion.

Add a few knots to your approach speed to reduce the danger of a wind shear induced stall.
