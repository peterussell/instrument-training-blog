# Landing Minimums Section

The landing minimums section provides information about how low you can descend toward a runway or airport, and what visibility you're required to have in order to land. It's made up of a number of different values and types of altitudes etc. which we'll discuss here.

# Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA)

 - an MDA is established based on the highest obstacle within a specified distance of the approach
 - a full-scale deflection of your CDI could mean you're beyond the obstacle-protected area by one inch or one mile, you can't tell with a full-scale deflection
   - this is why it's smart to execute a missed approach when the needle is at or approaching a full-scale deflection
 - the MDA is the altitude published in the minimums section beyond which you can't descend unless you have the required minimum in-flight visibility established by TERPs, as well as one or more specific items in the runway environment ([FAR 91.175][far-91-175]) (more on this later)

# Mininmum In-Flight Visibility Requirement

 - remembering FAR 91.175, the visibility minimums will always be shown in the minimums section of the approach chart
 - this visibility minimum is **required to legally descend below the MDA**
 - the values for visibility minimums can be affected by factors such as runway lighting type and surrounding environment
 - **Important:** visibility is *in the direction in which you'll point your airplane for landing* - ie. vertical visibility (on top of the runway) isn't counted ... or particularly useful

# Height Above Touchdown (HAT)

 - this is the smaller number printed beside the MDA
 - for any straight-in landing minimum, the approach chart will always provide you with your height above the TDZE
 - the numbers to the right of this (in parentheses) are military minimums, so don't worry about them

# Aircraft Approach Categories

 - because different airplanes approach at different speeds, the FAA divides them into different 'categories' and gives them different altitude and visibility minimums
 - the categories are A, B, C, D, and E, although usually only the first four (A - D) are shown
 - each category is based *mulitplying 1.3 times the airplane's Vso*
   - **Category A:** 0 - 90 KTS
   - **Category B:** 91 - 120 KTS
   - **Category C:** 121 - 140 KTS
   - **Category D:** 141 - 165 KTS
   - **Category E:** >= 166 KTS
 - **You should use the category you intend to fly the approach at**
   - *example: even if your 1.3 x Vso is a Category A, if you're approaching at 105 KTS then you should use the Category B visibility minimums*

# Circling Minimums

 - circling minimums are provided in case you need to land on a runway other than the one the approach is designed for
 - they are typically higher than straight-in minimums
 - the **circling area** is defined by drawing arcs of specific radii from each runway threshold, and connecting these arcs by tangents
 - within the circling area described, you're **guaranteed 300' obstacle clearance**
 - the circling area radii are:
   - **Category A:** 1.3 miles
   - **Category B:** 1.5 miles
   - **Category C:** 1.7 miles
   - **Category D:** 2.3 miles
   - **Category E:** 4.5 miles
 - it's therefore very important to know which category you're in, and how far that lets you go from the runway centerline
 - eg. if you're cleared to an airport and told to 'circle north of runway 9', then you want to make sure - if a Category B airplane - that you don't maneuver *any further than 1.5 miles from the runway centerline*

**Circling Restricted by Approach Charts**

 - it's possible that the approach chart will restrict your circling behaviour in some way
 - *example: 'Circling not authorized North of Rwy 9-27 for Cat D aircraft'*
 - however, if you're not restricted by the chart (there are some other restrictions we'll discuss later) or ATC, then you *may circle to land as you see fit*

# Height Above Airport (HAA)

 - because the area covered by circling minimums increases significantly with each increase in speed, each category requires different obstacle clearances. The HAT also doesn't make sense, since that only applies to the runway the approach is designed for
 - in this case, we define Height Above Airport, which is the smaller number displayed below the MDA for the circling approach

# Losing Sight of the Runway While Circling

 - for example, if you had the airport in sight, but then penetrate a low layer of clouds and lose visual contact with the runway
 - in this case:
   - **make a climbing turn toward the landing runway**
     - this always keeps you closer to the middle of the airport and helps avoid straying from the protected area
   - **follow the published missed approach procedure**

# Missed Approaches

 - missed approach information is displayed in the **middle briefing area** (textual), the plan view, and the **profile view** (graphical)
 - missed approaches provide a place (in the form of a hold) to assess the situation and decide what to do next, namely try the approach again, or divert
 - TERPs criteria require that all missed approaches have a **minimum climb gradient of 200' per NM to the missed approach holding altitude** (a *rate* of 300 FPM at 90 knots)
