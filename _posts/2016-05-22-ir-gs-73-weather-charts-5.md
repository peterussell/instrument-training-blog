# Convective (Severe) Weather Outlook Chart

 - the *Convective Outlook Chart* is a **preliminary outlook for thunderstorms**,
   specifically *severe (hail 1" diameter, and/or wind gusts >= 50 knots)*, and
   **non-severe general convection** along with specific weather threats
 - it covers the **following three consecutive days**
 - *it's basically a map of where not to go*
 - it's issued in two panels: Day 1 and Day 2
    - **Day 1** is a 24 hour forecast for areas expected to have thunderstorms
       - it's issued five times daily, starting at 0600Z, and is valid from 1200Z
         that day until 1200Z the following day. It's issued again at 1300Z, 1630Z,
         2000Z and 0100Z, which each issuance valid until 1200Z the following day
    - the **Day 2** panel contains the same information as the Day 1 convective
      outlook, except that it's issued *twice daily*, beginning at 0830Z. It's updated
      at 1730Z and covers the time from 1200Z on the *following day* to 1200Z
      the next day
 - both panels in the Convective Outlook chart qualify the levels of severe
   thunderstorm risk as *SLGT, MDT,* and *HIGH*
 - they also show the areas where general (non-severe) thunderstorms are expected
   to exist
 - **areas are depicted as a line with an arrow at the end - if you're facing the
   direction of the arrow, then thunderstorm activity is expected *to the right of
   the line***
 - if *other than general thunderstorm activity is forecast* (ie. severe thunderstorms)
   then the terms SLGT, MDT, or HIGH will be used to indicate the expected risk of
   severe thunderstorms
    - **if you see SLGT, MDT, or HIGH, then it's talking about *severe* thunderstorms,
      otherwise they're talking about *general* thunderstorms**
 - *there's more information on the charts and how to interpret it on page 10-30*
 - these areas can also include **tornadoes** (and hurricanes?)

# Convective Outlook (AC)

 - in addition to the convective outlook *chart*, there's also the convective outlook
   text (example on page 10-31)
 - this is a **textual representation of forecast thunderstorms** - the Convective
   Outlook chart refers you to it whenver you see 'See Text'
    - 'See Text' on the Convective Outlook chart indicates that a SLGT designation
      (see above) was considered at the time of the forecast but decided it wasn't
      warranted

# Surface Analysis

 - Surface Analysis charts show the location of pressure patterns and fronts
 - the chart is **issued every 3 hours**, and is based on *reported data*
 - **individual reporting stations  and their associated weather are reported on the
   chart**
    - you can think of the Surface Analysis chart as a visual depiction of hundreds of
      METARs
 - oreintation of the isobars and the pressure patterns gives you a good idea of
   surface winds
 - cloud coverage at the time the chart was constructed is identified by the fill of
   the individual station circles (although it *doesn't* show cloud height)
 - it can be a useful exercise to *compare the current locations of systems and fronts
   on the Surface Analysis chart with the predicted future locations on the 12 and 24
   hour prog charts*, which tells you where these fronts are now and where they're
   likely to be headed
 - the symbols on this chart aren't covered in the text, it refers to the *Avation
   Weather Services Handbook* for more information

# Constant Pressure Chart
 - these charts provide you with **atmospheric moisture conditions**
 - the values are depictions of *upper atmospheric soundings*, made by radiosonde
   ascensions
 - the measurements are in Millibars (mb), we are probably concerned with measurements
   at **850mb (5,000')** and **700mb (10,000')**
 - the chart shows **Reporting Stations** as small circles on the chart
 - to the **left of each Reporting Station** are two numbers on top of each other:
    - the top number is the *temperature*, and the bottom is the *temperature/dewpoint
      spread*, eg. 05 / 10 would be +5 deg C, with a dewpoint spread of 10 deg (dewpoint
      is -5 deg C)
    - station models are *filled in solid whenever the temp/dewpoint spread is less
      than 5 degrees*
    - you can use these numbers to determine when and where condensation will occur,
      along with when and where you need to be concerned about icing
 - compare the current Constant Pressure chart to tell whether the air is getting wetter
   or drier
 - the Constant Pressure chart is also useful to help determine **wind direction**, by
   referencing the depicted isobars
    - **areas of strong winds (70 - 110 knots) are identified by hatching**

# High-Level Significant Weather Prog Chart

 - gives an **overview of flying conditions above FL240** (pertains to FL240 - FL600)
 - issued **4 times a day**, with valid times of 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z
 - contains information about **jet streams, cumulonimbus clouds, turbulence,** and
   **tropopause heights**
    - surface fronts are also included for perspective, along with other conditions like
      tropical cyclones, squall lines, volcanic eruption sites, sandstorms, and
      duststorms
 - **tropopause heights** are enclosed by rectangles and plotted in hundreds of feet
   (eg. 340), the **centers** of the highest and lowest are identified with 'H' and 'L'
   respectively, along with their heights, and enclosed by a polygon
 - **areas of moderate or greater turbulence** are enclosed by **bold dashed lines**
   with intensities identified by the same symbols as as the *Lowl Level Significant
   Weather Prog Chart* (witches hats), along with the altitudes
    - *example: 430/320 = 32,000' up to 43,000'*
    - altitudes that extend **below the level of the chart** are idenfied with 'XXX',
      *example: 330/XXX = 24,000' (bottom of the high-level sig wx prog chart) up to
      33,000'*
 - areas of CB (cumulonimbus) that meet certain criteria are enclosed by scallopped lines
    - what criteria? Widespread CBs with an area or along a line with little or no space
      between individual clouds, and CBs that are embedded in cloud layers or concealed
      by haze or dust
    - (summary: CBs that are joined together, or obscured somehow)
    - the high-level sig wx prog chart *does not* show scattered CBs that are not
      embedded in clouds, haze, or dust
 - coverage values for the identifiers are: isolated (ISOL), occasional (OCNL), and
   frequent (FRQ)
    - ISOL and OCNL CBs can be further characterized as embeddded (EMBD)
 - **jet streams** with a *maximum speed of more than 80 knots* are identified by
   **bold lines**
     - arrowheads on the lines indicate the orientation of each jet stream
     - double hatched lines along the jet core indentify **changes of wind speed**
     - these speed indicators are drawn at 20 knot intervals and begin at 100kts
     - wind speed maximums along the jet core are characterized by wind symbols and
       altitudes
     - a standard wind symbol with pennants (50 knots for each flag) and barbs (10
       knots for each barb) is placed at each pertinent position to identify velocity
     - the altitude in hundreds of feet prefaced with FL is placed adjacent to each
       wind symbol

# Observed Winds Aloft Chart

 - this is a four-panel, **twice daily (1200Z and 0000Z)** chart that **depicts the
   winds and temperatures at the *second standard level*, and at 14,000', 24,0000',
   and 34,000'**
    - **second standard level**: the altitude for a reporting point that's **between
      1,000' and 2,000' AGL** at that station
    - the purpose of the second standard level is to help determine any low-level
      wind shear and ground frictional effects on lower atmospheric winds
    - in practical terms, looking at this second standard altitude level might help
      you anticipate how your airplane will be affected during an IAP
 - **wind direction and speed** are drawn to the nearest 10 degree increment (you make
   the call about whether it's from the 100s, 200s, or 300s degree sectory), eg. if you
   see a '9' at the tail of the arrow, you make the call about if it's 090, 190, or 290
    - the second digit of the two of three degree reference is shown at the tail of
      the arrow (temperature is shown at the head). One way to remember which is which
      is that the wind direction is in the position that the barb is coming *from* (like
      the wind)
    - each full arrow feather represents 10 knots of wind, each half feather is 5 knots
 - calm, or light and variable wind is 'LV', or '00'
 - a missing wind is 'M'
 - both of the above two are plotted to the lower right of the station circle
 - the station circle is filled in when the temp/dewpoint spread is <= 5 deg C

# In-flight Weather Advisories

In-flight Weather Advisories are forecasts that *advise pilots of potentially hazardous
weather*, some of which might have been forecasted, some of which might be a complete
surprise.

These can be obtained through:

 - a weather briefer/briefing
 - HIWAS broadcasts over specific VORs and NDBs
 - EFAS (Flight Watch)

There are three types of advisories:

 1. SIGMETs
 2. AIRMETs
 3. Convective SIGMETs

**SIGMET**

 - a SIGMET is an **advisory of non-convective weather** (non-thunderstorm weather)
   **that is potentially hazardous to all aircraft**
 - SIGMETs are issued when any of the following occur, or are *expected* to occur:
    - severe icing not associated with thunderstorms
    - severe or extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with
      thunderstorms
    - dust storms, sandstorms, and volcanic ash that lower surface visbility to < 3 SM
    - volcanic eruptions
 - the **maximum forecast period of a SIGMET is 4 hours**, but may be continued or
   updated if necessary
 - SIGMETs are named by the phonetic letters from November through Yankee, excluding
   Sierra, Tango, and Zulu (which are used for AIRMETs)
    - you can use the specific name to see whether it has been amended or canceled when
      calling a FSS

*example:*

DFWA UWS 051710<br>
SIGMET PAPA 1 VALID UNTIL 052110<br>
AR LA MS<br>
FROM MEM TO 30N MEI TO BTR TO MLU TTO MEM<br>
OCNL SVR ICING ABV FRZLVL EXPCD.<br>
FRZLVL 080 E TO 120 W<br>
CONDS CONTG BYD 2100Z.<br>

 - issued for the DFW area at 1710Z on the 5th
 - is valid until the 5th at 2110Z
 - UWS = Urgent Weather SIGMET, this is included in the first issuance of a SIGMET
 - this SIGMET is named PAPA 1, indicating it's the first SIGMET issued in this specific
   area
    - issuances for the same weather phenomena will be sequentially numbered using the
      original name (PAPA 2, PAPA 3, ...)
 - the SIGMET is for Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi
 - the area is from MEM to 30N of MEI to BTR to MLU to MEM
 - you can expect icing above the freezing level
 - the freezing level is from 8,000' eastward to 12,000' westward

**AIRMET**

 - AIRMETs **warn of significan weather but at intensities less than those that trigger
   SIGMETs**
 - they are intended for all pilots
 - AIRMETs are issued **once every 6 hours on a scheduled basis, with unscheduled
   amendments issued as required**
    - each AIRMET issuance contains AIRMETs still in effect, significant weather not
      meeting AIRMET criteria, and an outlook for conditions expected after the AIRMET
      valid period
 - AIRMETs are **valid for a period of 6 hours**
 - AIRMETs caontain one or more of the following weather phenomena when they occur or
   are forecast to occur:
    - moderate icing
    - moderate turbulence
    - sustained winds of 30 knots or more at the surface
    - ceilings of less than 1,000' and/or vis < 3 miles, affecting more than 50% of the
      area at one time,
    - extensive mountain obscuration
 - AIRMETs have identifiers:
    - Sierra = IFR and mountain obscurations
    - Tango = Turbulence, strong surface winds, and low-level wind shear
    - Zulu = icing and freezing level heights

*example:*

DFWT WA 051445<br>
AIRMET TANGO UPDT 2 FOR TURBC VALID UNTIL 052100<br>
AIRMET TURBC...TN AL AND CSTL WTRS<br>
FROM SLK TO FLOW TO 90S SJI TO MEI TO BUF TO SLK<br>
OCNL MDT TURBC BLO 60 DUE TO STG AND GUSTY LOW LVL WINDS.<br>
CONDS CONTG BYD 2100Z.<br>

 - issued for Dallas/Ft. Worth on the 5th at 1445Z
 - the T following DFW indicates the type of AIRMET
 - this is an updated and valid until 2100Z
 - it applies to the area around Tennessee, Alabama, and coastal waters
 - the area described is expected to have moderate turbulence below 6,000' MSL due
   to strong and gusty low-level winds
 - the conditions are expected to continue beyond the AIRMET's valid time of 2100Z

**Convective SIGMETs (WST)**

 - these are for the **most extreme conditions** - weather you really don't want
   to mess with
 - report things that are harzardous to all aircraft
 - a convective SIGMET is an **advisory associated with convective activity such as
   severe thunderstorms**.
 - **any convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and
   low-level wind shear**
 - a Convective SIGMET may be issued as a result of any of the following:
    - a line of thunderstorms at least 60 miles long, with thunderstorms affecting
      at least 40% of its length
    - an area of thunderstorms affecting at least 3,000' square miles covering at
      least 40% of the area
    - embedded or severe thunderstorms expected to occur more than 30 minutes during
      the valid period, regardless of the size of the area

*example:*

MKCC WST 221855<br>
CONVECTIVE SIGMET 20C<br>
VALID UNTIL 2055Z<br>
KS OK TX<br>
VCNTY GLD-CDS LINE<br>
FCST TO 2055Z<br>
LINE TSTMS DVLPG BY 1955Z WILL MOVE EWD 30-35 KTS THRU 2055Z<br>
HAIL TO 1 1/2 IN PSBL<br>

OUTLOOK VALID 222055-230055<br>
ISOLD STG TSTMS WILL DVLP OVER SWRN KS<br>
THRUT FCST PD AS UPR LVL TROF MOVS NEWD OVER VERY UNSTBL AMS.<br>

 - issued on the 22nd at 1855Z
 - it's the 20th consecutive SIGMET (20C) issued on this day in the central US
 - it references a line in the vicinity of GLD to CDS
 - it forecasts a line of thunderstorms developing by 1955Z, moving eastward
   at 30 to 35 knotsuntil 2055Z
 - hail to one and a half inches is also possible

Convective SIGMETs also include an outlook, which is a forecast for thunderstorms that
are expected to require convective SIGMET issuance 2 to 6 hours into the future.

In our example, isolated strong thunderstorms will develop over southwestern Kansas
through the forecast period as an upper level trough moves northeastward over very
unstable air

# PIREPs

 - very useful to provide information to ATC, briefers, etc. on actual conditions
 - the format categories for a PIREP are:
    - UA - routine PIREP, UUA is urgent
    - /OV - location (use 3 letter NVAID idents only)
    - /TM - time (4 digits in UTC)
    - /FL - altitude/flight level (3 digits for hundreds of feet, unknown = UNKN)
    - /TP - type of aircraft (4 digits maximum, eg. C172)
    - /SK - cloud layers
       - clount amount
       - height of cloud bases
       - height of cloud tops
    - /WX - weather
       - flight visibility (FV)
       - precipitation
       - restrictions to visibility etc.
       - use the same formatting as for a METAR (eg. FV02SM -RA HZ = vis 2 miles in light
         rain and haze)
    - /TA - air temperature in deg C
    - /WV - wind (direction and speed in 6 digits)
    - /TB - turbulence (see below for definitions)
    - /IC - icing (standard intensity and type contractions, eg. /IC LGT-MOD RIME)
    - /RM - remarks (free form text to clarify the report)

**Turbulence**

 - **Light:** occupants may feel slight strain against seat belt, unsecured objects may
   move slightly
 - **Moderate:** unsecured objects are disloged. Occupants feel definite strains against
   seat belts and shoulder straps
 - **Severe:** occupants forced violently against seat belts or shoulder straps.
   Unsecured objects are tossed about. Food service and walking are impossible.
 - **Extreme:** aircraft is tossed violently about, impossible to control. May cause
   structural damage
 - **Clear Air Turbulence (CAT):** or 'chop' can be used to further describe the type of
   turbulence

# Putting it all Together

This gives outlines for which charts you can compare and what kind of information
that will help you gain, now that we know how to use them.

**Surface Map and Weather Depiction Chart**

 - the surface weather map tells you where the fronts and pressure systems are
 - comparing this with the weather depiction chart provides you with a picture of
   what these fronts and pressure systems are having on surface weather

**Weather Depiction Chart and Radar Summary Chart**

 - this gives you an idea of the convective activity associated with areas of IFR,
   MVFR, and VFR conditions
 - if an area of MVFR is associated with large, fast-moving echoes (thunderstorms)
   then you want to avoid that area
 - keep in mind that the *weather depiction chart will generally be a few hours older
   than the radar summary chart*

**Area Forecast and Prog Charts**

 - these are essentially the same information in differen formats, looking at them
   together can give you a better overall view of the forecast

**Weather Depiction and Prog Charts**

 - since the Weather Depiction chart shows the location of fronts and pressure systems,
   you can see which way these systems will move by comparing them against the 12 and
   24 hour prog chart
 - you'll also get an idea about what kind of weather (IFR/MVFR/VFR) will develop along
   the front by referring to the prog charts

**METARs/Surface Map**

 - compare individual METARs with the surface weather map
 - this provides you with an understanding of surface weather around and between your
   departure and destination
 - if the Surface map's reporting stations are all darkened-in along your route, this
   means you might be flying above a layer of clouds even though the destination is
   reporting clear conditions
 - look at the isobars and, using your knowledge about clockwise and counterclockwise
   air flow around highs and lows, decide on a route that increases the likelihood
   of a tailwind
 - remember, the *Surface Weather map may be up to 3 hours old*

**Winds Aloft, SIGMETs, AIRMETs, etc.**

 - finally, examine the winds aloft forecast for temperatures and selection of a
   favorable cruising altitude
 - examine the convective SIGMETs, SIGMETs, and AIRMETs for thunderstorms, turbulence,
   IFR, icing, etc.
