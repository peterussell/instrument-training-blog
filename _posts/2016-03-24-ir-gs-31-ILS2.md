# The Marker Beacons

 - marker beacons are ground stations that transmit a VHF signal vertically to marker beacon receivers in the airplane
 - marker beacon **sensitivity** is selectable as *high* or *low* on many units
   - the **low-sensitivity** position gives the sharpest indication of position, and *should be used for an approach*
   - the **high-sensitivity** position provides an earlier warning that the aprplane is approaching the marker beacon site
 - there are three types of marker beacons that can be associated with an ILS: *outer, middle, inner*
 - the purpose is to **provide you with an aural and visual alert of your position along the localizer**

# Decision Altitude and the Middle Marker (MM) **(orange)**

 - an ILS approach normally allows you to descent to 200' above the runways TDZE
   - at this height you decide whether you have the required minimum visibility to land
   - without this visibility and the runway environment in sight, you must execute a missed approach
 - a normal glideslope has an elevation of **200' at approximately 3,500' from the runway threshold**
 - the **Decision Altitude (DA)** is a critical height for instrument pilots, which is why the *middle marker (MM)* transmitter is approximately 3,500' from the threshold *(the actual distance typically varies from 2,400' - 4,200')*
 - while on the glideslope, at **Decision Height (DH)** you should see a flashing amber light and hear a series of **Morse code alternating dots and dashes**, this is how the MM is identified
   - if you don't hear the dots, the beacon is unreliable
 - **the purpose of the MM is to alert you that you're at or near DA**
 - this is how it would work in a perfect world, but sometimes the MM can't always be exactly at 3,500' from the threshold (because someone's house is there, for example) - but it should be pretty close

 - Decision **Altitude**: referenced to MSL
 - Decision **Height**: reference to the TDZE

# Outer Marker (OM), Precision Final Approach Fix (PFAF) **(blue)**

 - often installed at a point 4 - 7 miles from the runway threshold
 - it's located **approximately where you intercept the glideslope** and begin your descent to the runway
 - the place where you often (but not always) begin this descent is called the PFAF, or *Precision Final Approach Fix*
 - the outer marker is identified by a **blue** light in the cockpit and a series of **Morse code dashes**

# NDBs and Marker Beacons (Compass Locator)

 - NDB becons can be combined with either outer or middle marker beacons, this is called a **Compass Locator**
 - they're very useful because you can use your ADF to identify the position of the marker
   - the markers only project upward, so you *only know when you're over them*, when combined with an NDB transmission you can use it to find your way *to* the marker beacons as well
 - perhaps the most important reason for compass locators is that *they provide you with the ability to fly an NDB approach, too*
 - NDBs have three-letter Morse code identifiers
 - **NDBs at outer compass locators** (sometimes referred to as a LOM, or Locator Outer Marker) use the *first two letters* of the three-letter localizer ID
 - **NDBs at middle compass locators** (sometimes referred to as LMM, or Locator Middle Marker) use the *second two letters* of the localizer ID
   - *eg. if the localizer is I-LGB, then an outer compass locator (LOM) would be LG, and the middle compass locator (LMM) would be GB*

**Inner Markers (white)**

 - inner markers are used for flying a CAT II approach, which requires special equipment and isn't very relevant here
 - marks the DH on glidepath during a Category II approach
 - it's located on the front course between the MM and the landing threshold

# Marker Beacon Summary

 - **Outer Marker**
   - often 4-7 miles from the threshold
   - approximately where you intercept the glideslope
   - blue light
   - low-pitched tone with continuous dashes (2 per second)

 - **Middle Marker**
   - approximately 3,500' from the threshold
   - warns you that you're near or at DA
   - orange light
   - intermediate town, alternate dots and dashes

 - **Inner Marker**
   - between MM and threshold
   - gives DH for CAT II approaches
   - white light
   - high-pitched tone with continuous dots (6 per second)

 - **Back-Course Marker (BCM)** (where installed)
   - white light
   - high-pitched tone with two dots (72-75 per minute)
