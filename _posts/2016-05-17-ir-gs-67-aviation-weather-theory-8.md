# Fog

 - **fog is a cloud that touches the ground**
 - small temperature/dewpoint spreads are conducive to fog, which is why fog is common in the colder months
    - however, it can form any time the air contains enough moisture, condensation nuclei, and cooling
      temperatures
 - there are a number of different ways fog can form, which classifies the type of fog it is, we'll look at
   the different types here

**Radiation Fog**

 - radiation fog occurs when **the ground radiates its heat away**
 - on clear, calm nights, *terrestrial radiation* of heat cools the ground, which in turn cools the air
   resting next to the surface quickly
 - as air is cooled and approaches its dewpoint, water vapor condenses and forms a shallow layer of fog
 - radiation fog is very common at night and in the early morning
 - areas of high humidity (rain soaked ground, vegetation, rivers) are especially conducive to formation
   of radiation fog, golf courses are a common place for this type of fog
 - **winds up to about 5 knots** tend to mix and deepen the fog, where **higher winds** tend to disperse it
 - **solar heating of the earth after sunrise** tends to disperse the radiation fog (bigger temperature/
   dewpoint spread)
 - radiation fog dissipates around its periphery first, where it's thinnest
 - keep in mind that all this assumes a high-altitude cloud layer isn't preventing a reasonable amount of
   solar heat from reaching the surface


**Advection Fog**

 - *convection* means moving something vertically, ***advection*** means moving it *sideways*
 - advection fog is when fog that forms somewhere else comes to visit you
 - sometimes called **sea fog**, it's most common in coastal areas (although it can form inland too)
 - as **warmer, moist air comes in contact with the ocean's surface, air temperatures decrease and water
   vapor condenses**
 - with slight heating, the air pressure over land lowers, drawing advection fog inland
 - advection fog deepends when winds increase to about 15 knots, winds greater than this tend to lift fog
   layers into low stratus or straocumulus type clouds
    - (stratocumulus are a mixture of both stratus and cumulus)
 - advection fog can form quickly

**Upslope Fog**

 - occurs when warm, moist air is forced up the side of a mountain and condenses
 - **technically this cloud is is fog because it touches the surface of the mountain**
 - upslode fog **depends on wind** for its existence (and therefore not dependent on terrestrial cooling)
 - expect to see upslope fog in winter and spring on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains

**Precipitation-Induced Fog**

 - warm rain, falling through cooler air, can bring the air to the point of saturation, forming fog
 - commonly associated with **warm fronts**, where precipitation from the warm, low pressure air falls through
   into the cold, high pressure air, which cools the precipitation and causes fog to form
 - it can also occur in slow moving **cold fronts**, and **stationary fronts**

**Ice Fog**

 - forms in similar conditions to *radiation fog*, except the air temperature is **way below freezing**
 - instead of fog, you have **water sublimating directly into the air as ice crystals**
 - temperatures around -25 deg F are favorable for its formation
 - occurs mostly in the Arctic region, but not unknown in the middle latitudes

**Steam Fog**

 - a good example is a **heated swimming pool on a cold morning**
 - as dry, cold air passes over a body of warm water, **moisture evaporates rapidly from the surface**
 - condensation takes place as the cold air is rapidly saturated
 - water droplets often freeze, dropping back into the water as ice crystals
 - steam fog is conducive to low-level turbulence and icing
