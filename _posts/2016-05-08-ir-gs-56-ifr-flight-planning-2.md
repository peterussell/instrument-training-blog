# SIDs and STARs

When choosing a route, you want to consider whether the departure airport
has any published STARs, or SIDs for the destination. It's important to keep
in mind that they must be suitable (eg. some STARs may be for FL180, or
turboprop/jet only).

If there is a STAR or SID available then the route you file should match up
with a fix on that chart.

# No STAR

 - if there's no STAR you can use, you'll want to look at the airport approach
   chart and pick out a major navaid or intersection from which you can fly
   the approach without radar vectors
    - keep in mind that the overall idea is that you want to be able to fly to
      the airport and shoot the approach even in a lost comms situation
 - the most effective way is to find an IAF on the approach chart and list your
   routing to this point
 - the book offers the suggestion that an ILS (or LPV I guess?) is a good
   approach to initially look for, on the basis that if you're in a lost
   comms situation you want to fly the approach that has the highest chance
   of you landing in the worst weather conditions - because ILS/LPV approaches
   probably have lower approach minimums they fit the bill
 - even if you find and file for the ILS, there's a chance you may end up
   getting a different approach (possibly due to equipment failure, or landing
   on a different runway)
    - in this case, ATC may modify your clearance before departure, or enroute
 - *Summary:* the principle is to create a clearance that gives you a flyable,
   non-radar routing to one of the IAPs in the event of comms failure

# Choosing Alternate Airports

There are some important considerations for choosing the airport you want to
file as an alternate (or use as a real-life alternate):

 - you want it to be far enough away that the weather is likely to be different
   to the destination
    - if you can't complete the approach to the filed destination due to weather,
      then you want to the WX at the destination to have a good chance of being
      good enough to land there instead
    - you also might want to take into account geographic features, such as
      mountains, when considering whether the weather is likely to be different
      at the alternate
 - however, you don't want to list an alternate that's too far away
    - remember, FAR 91.167 says you need to carry enough fuel to fly to the
      alternate and a further 45 minutes at normal cruising speed

# WX Analysis

 - important to consider the weather at the departure and destinations *at the
   times you'll be there*
 - a good initial strategy is to think about the weather that's most likely to
   make or break a flight plan, eg. thunderstorms
 - there are three big weather events that can prevent completion of an IFR flight,
   and they *all involve water in the atmosphere*
    1. thunderstorms
    2. icing
    3. low landing visibility

**Thunderstorms**

 - convective activity (thunderstorms) is one of the biggest concerns, because
   it involves the most atmospheric water
 - it takes a lot of energy to suspend the water for creation of thunderstorms
   (we'll cover this soon under the weather section), that energy can be
   potentially destructive to you and the airplane
 - the only way to handle a thunderstorm *without onboard storm detection
   equipment* is to avoid them visually, **which you can't do in IMC**
    - if there are thunderstorms in those clouds, then you shouldn't be in those
      same clouds without storm detection eqiupment, period

**Icing**

 - you can often handle icing conditions by getting out of the clouds, or by
   moving to a temperature above freezing, although this isn't always a failsafe
 - the best way to handle icing is to avoid it in the first place

**Low Landing Visibility**

 - this can often be dealt with by flying an ILS or LPV approach, where the
   landing minimums are lower
 - it can also be handled by landing at a nearby airport and waiting for the
   weather, or just waiting for the weather to improve before departing
    - for example, sometimes it's better to wait for the sun to set because
      it's easier to see the approach or runway lights at night

# Onboard Storm Detection Equipment

Pilots are often told not to fly in the clouds when thunderstorms are present
unless they have *onboard storm detection equipment*. So what constitutes this
equipment?

 - **NEXRAD**
    - while NEXRAD information uplinked to the cockit is extremely useful, it
      should be considered a **strategic** tool to plan around areas of
      suspected thunderstorms, not a **tactical** one while in IMC
    - the problem with NEXRAD information is that **it can be up to 15 minutes
      old by the time you receive it**, and thunderstorms can grow thousands
      of feet per minute
 - **ATC Weather Information**
    - ATC's weather radar information (WARP) uses the same NEXRAD information you
      have in the cockpit, therefore it's still **strategic**, and not **tactical**
 - **Sferics**
    - Sferics, like Stormscope, **detect lightning**, and where there's lightning
      there are thunderstorms
    - the problem is that pre-thunderstorm clouds can still produce dangerous
      levels of turbulence
    - therefore, Sferics/Stormsscope alone can't provide a precise picture of where
      convective danger exists
 - **Onboard Weather Radar**
    - this is the only equipment that can detect suspeded water in real time
    - the *amount* of suspended water determines the probability of turbulence
      (recall, it takes more energy to keep more water in the air)
