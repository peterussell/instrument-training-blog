# No-FAF VOR Approach

 - *eg. the Paso Robles (PRB) VOR or GPS-A*
 - note that this approach also doesn't include any feeder routes (ie. no way to transition on to
   the approach structure)
 - in this case, the feeder routes exist in the form of airways leading to the primary navaid:
   the PRB VOR - arriving from any of these airways is an acceptable way to begin this approach
 - this chart indicates a 45-180 procedure turn, and no reference to 'NoPT', therefore no matter which
   airway you arrive at the VOR from, you *must execute the procedure turn*

**NoPT Arrivals**

 - some charts have something called a 'NoPT arrival sector'
 - eg. approaching the Scaggs VOR for the approach on V87 and V108 are prohibited from flying the
   Procedure Turn, as indicated by NoPT on the **approach chart**
     - the text will say something like "NoPT for arrivals on SGD VORTAC Airway Radials 114
       clockwise to 165"

(back to it...)

 - not all approaches have a FAF (indicated by the Maltese Cross)
 - these approaches still have a **Final Approach Point (FAP)**
 - the **FAP** is defined as the point where the final approach descent can be made once the airplane
   has turned inbound on the approach after completing the procedure turn
    - *in the case of the PRB VOR or GPS-A, when you're inbound after the procedure turn, you may
      descend to the circling MDA of 2,100'

# Visual Descent Points (VDPs)

 - a VDP is depicted on an approach chart as a downward-pointing black filled arrow on the profile view
 - VDPs are navigation references identified either by marker beacons, DME, or IFR approved GPS readings
 - when a VDP exists on an approach (and you have the equipment onboard to identify the VDP), you **must
   wait until reaching the VDP before descending from the MDA**
 - **you should not descend below the MDA prior to reaching the VDP *even if the runway is clearly in sight***
 - **if you don't have equipment to identify the VDP**, fly the approach as if no VDP exists
 - it's located along the final approach segment of a straight-in, non-precision approach
 - the **main purpose** of the VDP is to prevent a premature descent from the MDA after visual contact
   with the runway or approach lights has been established
 - it's also a clue that descents beyond the VDP may require higher than normal descent rates to make
   the runway
 - *descents from the VDP provide a **descent gradient of 300' to 400' per NM** to the **first 3,000'
   of the landing surface**

# Cleared for 'Cruise'

 - 'cruise' has an exact meaning
 - if ATC clears you to 'cruise' (eg. at 1,000')
   - you've been assigned a block of airspace from the minimum IFR altitude up to and including the
     assigned cruising altitude
   - you may climb or descend within that block at your discretion
   - however, **if you verbally report leaving an altitude in a descent** you may not return to that
     altitude without specific permission
   - so, don't report leaving an altitude if you plan on returning to it
 - a cruise clearance is **also approval for you to proceed to and make an approach at the destination
   airport**

# Contact and Visual Approaches

Two types of approaches don't require use of an instrument approach chart: Contact and Visual

**Contact Approach**

 - a *contact approach* is the instrument pilot's version of special VFR
 - it's an official IFR approach *initiated by the pilot* when operating
    - clear of clouds
    - with at least 1 mile visibility
    - they believe they can continue to the destination airport in these conditions
 - it can be used (for example) when being radar vectored for an approach over an area you're
   familiar with, and in conditions that satisfy the above requirements. It may well save time
   being vectored for and flying the full approach
 - a second example is when approaching an airport that's IFR while you're under VFR conditions
   - if you can see the airport from above (ie. CoC and 1 mile vis) you could ask for a Contact
     Approach and circle down to the airport
 - they also give you **priority over any Special VFR traffic**

**Requirements for a Contact Approach**

 - reported ground visibility at the airport must be at least one mile
 - the airport must have a published instrument approach procedure
   - required in case you need to make a missed approach

**Visual Approach**

 - can be initiated by the controller (unlike a contact approach)
 - allow you to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport
 - is **not an official instrument approach procedure** because it makes no provision for re-entering
   the IFR system via a missed approach (a missed approach is not expected if the airport is VFR)
 - if you accept a visual approach to a non-towered airport, you're **still required to cancel your
   IFR flight plan**
 - some visual approaches are charted (eg. QUIET BRIDGE VISUAL RWYS 28L/R at SFO), in this case you
   should follow the special instructions shown on the chart if you're using this specific procedure
    - **Charted Visual Flight Procedures (CFPs)** are charts, often based on visual and instrument landmarks

**Requirements for a Visual Approach**

 - must have either the:
   - airport in sight
   - another airplane ahead that's heading to the airport in sight
   - ceiling at the airport must be **at least 1,000'**
   - visibility at the airport must be **at least 3 miles**

**Visual Approaches at Night**

 - if you are told to follow another airplane, it's your responsibility to maintain a safe
   distance behind them to remain free of wake turbulence
 - this can be very difficult to judge at night (even for big airplanes)
 - especially critical because **radar service is terminated when instructed to contact the tower**

# Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)

 - a STAR is a graphic or textual preplanned ATC procedure that's published by the FAA
 - it provides a **transition from the enroute structure to a fix typically found on an instrument
   approach chart**
 - they contain ATC's preferred routing
 - it helps simplify the clearance delivery procedure, meaning lower workloads for you and controller
 - *example: the Tandy Three Arrival at Long Beach*
 - STARs for all airports in the NACO instrument approach booklet are found at the beginning of the
   book in **Section P**
 - if you'd prefer ATC not assign you a STAR, you can put the words **"No STAR"** in the remarks
   section of your flight plan
 - unless you opt out, or conditions are different than normal, you stand a chance of getting a STAR
   when arriving at busy airports, especially if flying a high-performance, turbine, or jet
 - if you want to **include a STAR as part of your routing**, place the code shown in the title of the
   chart (eg. TANDY.TAND3) in the **route section of the flight plan**
    - if you want to transition via a different intersection/VOR/etc., you use the computer code
      for the transition from that position, eg. FLW.TANDY3

# Side-Step Approaches

 - allows you to shoot an approach to one runway, then side-step over to a parallel runway
 - allowed in the case it provides 'operational advantage', eg. airplane before you taking too long
   to clear the runway
 - runways:
    - must be **parallel**
    - must be **separated by 1,200' or less**
 - *eg. 'Cessna 2132 Bravo, cleared ILS Runway 6R approach. Sidestep to runway 6L.'
 - sidestep approach MDAs may be printed on the approach chart, in which case:
    - **a sidestep approach using a precision approach AUTOMATICALLY becomes a non-precision approach**

# Radar Approaches

**Air Route Surveillance Radar (ASR) Approaches**

 - a radar-vectored approache where a controller provides navigation guidance to the runway
 - eg. **in an emergency** (approach charts fall and become unreachable)
 - an ASR approach is also a simple way for the FAA to **establish an instrument approach at an airport
   with no nearby navaids** (pre-GPS)
 - if your airport has ASR approach capability and you ask the controller for an ASR approach, you'll
   be given headings that align your airplane with the extended centerline of the runway
 - ASR is considerably less precise than a precision approach (eg. ILS), therefore **higher minimums
   will apply**
 - you'll also be advised of the location of the MAP and location of the airplane's position on each
   mile of the final approach
 - if requested, you can also be given recommended altitudes at each mile on final, down to the last
   mile that's at or above the MDA

**ASR Approach Requirements**

 - the airport must have published approach mininmums
 - the ASR minimums are available in **Section N2 of the NACO chart booklet**
    - these are the minimums you'd use when advised to commence descent to the MDA, or to an
      intermediate stepdown fix if appropriate

**Precision Approach (PAR)**

 - an ASR approach provides only heading (azimuth) information and *recommends* altitudes
 - a PAR approach provides highly accurate azimuth and elevation
 - both ASR and PAR approaches are often military, because they can be established quickly with
   just radar services and a quick terrain survey
 - during a PAR, you're given headings to fly that direct you to the extended centerline, and
   are told to anticipate glidepath interception 10 to 30 seconds before it occurs, and when
   to start descent to the DA
 - if you **deviate from the glidepath**, you'll be given relative amount of deviation by terms
   such as 'slightly' or 'well'
 - trend information is also issued with respect to elevation with terms like 'rapidly' or 'slowly'
 - *eg. 'well above glidepath, coming down rapidly'*
 - range from touchdown is given at least once each mile

**PAR Requirements**

 - PAR minimums are in the Radar Instrument Approach Minimums, **NACO booklet Section N2**

**No Gyro Approach**

 - available if your DG or Stabilized Compass has become inop or inaccurate
 - if this occurs, advise ATC and request a no-gyro vector or approach
 - make **all turns at standard rate immediately upon receipt of instructions**
 - after the aircraft has been turned onto final approach you'll be advised to make turns at half
   standard rate
