# Approach Lighting System (ALS)

 - the ALS exists to help pilots flying an instrument approach transition to visual flight for landing.
 - there are two basic light systems:
   - **Precision** instrument runway ALS (appear to be the *longer* approach lighting)
   - **Nonprecision** instrument runway ALS (appear to be the *shorter* approach lighting)

# Precision Instrument Runway ALSs

 - two common precision instrument runway ALSs are named **ALSF-1** and **ALSF-2**
 - the ALSF 1 and 2 systems are often 2,500' to 3,000' in length, and stop at the runway threshold
 - the 'F' stands for *sequenced flashing lights*, a white burst of light moving toward the runway
   - where possible, sequenced flashing lights are built into the ALS and stop at the **decision bar**, located **1,000' from the end of the runway**
   - sometimes also called 'the rabbit'
   - some pilots find the sequenced lights distracting and may ask for them to be turned off
 - as a general rule, any ALS 2,400' - 3,000' long is usually associated with a precision instrument runway

(A 'Precision Instrument Runway' is a thing, it will be covered later)

# Nonprecision Instrument Runway ALSs

 - typically (not always) 1,400' in length, consisting of seven white light bars separated by 200' (=1,400')
 - here are examples of the five additional categories of approach lighting systems:

 1. **MALS:** Medium Intensity ALS
 2. **MALSR:** MALS with *runway alighment indicator lights (RAIL)
    - RAIL is a series of five or more sequenced flashing lights that are separate from the 1,400' ALS system
    - MALSR systems are typically 2,400' long
    - basically MALS but with an extra center strip extending out (toward the airplane)
 3. **MALSF:** Medium Intensity ALS with sequenced flashers
    - typically 1,400' long
    - it has an extra three white light bars on the outer end (toward the airplane) with sequenced flashing lights
    - when the SF are bembedded this way it suggests there is extensive ambient and background lighting (eg. from a city or road), and it's necessary to have the flashers closer to the runway to help you accurately identify the landing area
 4. **SSALR:** Simplified Short ALS with RAIL
    - a simplified short ALS can be upgraded to 2,400' to 3,00' in length
    - the SF in this system have a separate on-off switch, but not a separate intensity control - the SF match the intensity settings of the runway lights and runway edge lights
 5. **SSALF:** Simplified Short ALS with SF
    - similar to SSALR except that its SF are embedded in the outer three white bars

# Other Types of ALS

 - **REIL:** Runway End Identifier Lights
   - two synchronized flashing white lights placed on each side of the runway threshold
 - **ODALS:** Omni-Directional Approach Lighting System
   - usually consists of 7 omnidirectional flashing lights exneding up to 1,500' from the threshold
   - ODALS helps guide airplanes, under reasonable visibility conditions, to the runway threshold
   - first 5 lights are aligned with the runway centerline, the other two are located on either side of the threshold
