Certain terrain features and atmospheric conditions create optical illusions and affect your ability to see what's really true. These illusions are primarily associated with landing. They're especially important to be aware of when transitioning from flying on instruments to a visual approach.

# Runway Width Illusion

 - **Narrower Runway:** creates the illusion that you're **further** from the runway than you really are, making you think you're too **high** on the approach
 - **Wider Runway:** creates the illusion that you're **closer** to the runway than you really are, making you think you're too **low** on the approach

# Runway Slope Illusion

 - **Upsloping Runway:** creates the illusion that you're **higher** than you really are
 - **Downsloping Runway:** creates the illusion that you're **lower** than you really are

# Featureless Terrain / Black Hole Illusion

 - the absence of ground features creates the illusion that the airplane is **higher** than it actually is (think of the objects being so small you can't see them)

# Water Refraction Illusion

 - water on the windscreen can refract light, creating the illusion that you're **higher** than you really are

# Haze

 - objects, including airports, appear **further** away in haze
 - this could result in flying a higher than normal approach, since you'd fly at a higher altitude further from the runway
 - the opposite problem can exist in extremely clear air, although it's less common

# Fog

 - fog can create the illusion that your airplane's **pitching up**
 - this can result in steepening the descent beyond what's required

# Ground Lighting Illusions

 - during an approach, it's easy to mistake road lighting, trains, etc. as approach or runway lighting
 - for this reason it's important to review the airport diagram to check the type of approach lighting, at very least to know what the shape of the expected lighting should be as you approach minimums - you don't want to accidentally descend below minimums because you thought a road was the approach lighting system

# Preventing Landing Errors Due to Visual Illusions

 - study the airport diagram for the expected lighting layout, and the **A/FD** for notes or diagrams of nearby roads that may have misleading lighting on them
 - anticipate how holding a wind correction angle will impact the angle of approach lights relative to the airplane
 - look up runway slope information and be prepared for the Runway Slope Illusion
 - use any and all glidepath aids (PAPI, VASI, etc.) and the VDP (Visual Descent Point) for non-precision approaches if available on the approach chart

# Factors Affecting Night Vision

Dark adaptation (ability to adjust or re-adjust your eyes to limited light) is affected by:

 - cabin pressure altitudes over 5000' (or sometimes lower)
 - carbon monoxide from smoking or exhaust fumes
 - Vitamin A deficiency
 - prolonged exposure to bright sunlight

Dark adaptation is lost after a few seconds of viewing a bright light. When flying near lightning, it's a good idea to increase cockpit lights to prevent loss of night vision due to the bright flashes.
