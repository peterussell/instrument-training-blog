# Required Navigational Performance (RNP)

 - exists to provide a means to assure you that your RNAV equipment (GPS in this case) is capable of
   remaining in the area that's without obstacles
 - it gives you the precision you can expect, eg. 0.3NM, and how often you can expect it to be true,
   eg. 95% of the time
 - *example: if a GPS approach requires an RNP of 0.3 (a standard value), it basically means that a pilot
   tracking a course on final approach with a centered needle can expect to be within 0.3NM of the
   centerline at least 95% of the time*
 - if the primary protected airspace on either side of the course centerline is 0.5NM, then you have a
   high probability of *being* within this primary area if the needle says you're there
 - **all IFR-certified GPS units in airplanes at the time of this writing meet RNP-0.3 performance
   standards**

**Finding the RNP required for an approach**

 - you can assume that the standard RNP for all GPS approaches is RNP-0.3
 - if an approach requires a different RNP based on it being flown with RNAV equipment other than a GPS,
   then that RNP value or restriction will be in the briefing area of the chart

# GPS Chart Formats

There are four GPS chart formats: **Standard I, Standard T, Modified T, and TAA**.

**Standard I Chart Format**

 - the approach configuration on a *Standard I* chart is called this because the approach course, or
   the **approach procedure track** looks like a straight line, like an 'I'
 - the minimums section on this chart has the same formatting as on a non-GPS approach chart

**Standard T Chart Format**

 - similarly, the *Standard T* format is named because the approach courses from each IAF form the shape
   of a 'T' (eg. RNAV (GPS) RWY 16L at Manassas Regional (HEF))
 - the main difference between the Standard T and other formats is that the Standard T **doesn't provide
   a holding pattern for course reversal**
    - in fact, this is what makes it a bit superior to the Standard I
 - instead of a course reversal, it provides two, or sometimes three IAF points where you can begin the
   approach, meaning you don't require a course reversal, just use the IAF that makes sense
 - the IAFs all lead to the IF, which is in the middle of the top of the T shape
 - from here, the approach attempts to align the runway's centerline with three things:
    1. the intermeiate segment
    2. the FAF
    3. the MAWP
 - local conditions don't always permit this alignment, but the formatting still strives for the basic T
   formation

 - **Flyover Waypoints (FOWPs)**
    - shown on the approach chart as a four-pointed star surrounded by a circle
    - these are airspace fixes that your airplane **must cross before making any turns**
    - they exist to keep you within the boundaries of the (usually very small) primary obstacle
      protection area
    - typically found at the Missed Approach Waypoint (MAWP) and Missed Approach Holding Waypoint (MAHWP)
    - making turns prior to either of these intersections can reduce critical terrain and obstruction
      clearance, or prevent your GPS sequencing between the waypoints necessary for the missed approach
 - **Flyby Waypoints (FBWP)**
    - shown on the chart as a four-pointed star *without* any circle (ie. the standard waypoint icon)
    - they require the use of turn anticipation to avoid overshooting the next segment

**Modified T Chart Format**

 - these are like the Standard T, but with segments from the IAF to IF that aren't necessarily
   perpendicular to the final approach course, or may even be missing
 - these also don't usually include a holding pattern
 - these are also designed (like the Standard T format) for approaches to single and multiple runways

**TAA Chart Format**
