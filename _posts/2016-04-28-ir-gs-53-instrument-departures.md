# Controlled vs Uncontrolled Airspace

 - the primary purpose of ATC is to provide separation between IFR airplanes in *controlled* airspace
 - IFR aircraft can and do operate in uncontrolled (Class G) airspace
    - in this situation, it's up to the PIC to maintain obstacle avoidance (and everything else)

**Reasons For Being in Uncontrolled Airspace**

 - you'll most often be there because controlled airsplace (Class E) doesn't reach the ground
 - airports with a control tower are usually in Class B, C, or D airspace, which begins at the surface
 - Class E also often begins at the surface, denoted by a **dashed magenta line**, it can also start at higher
   altitudes, like 700' or 1,200' AGL
    - in this case, the airspace is uncontrolled (Class G) up to the bottom of controlled (Class E) airspace, and you'll
      be ascending (or descending, for an arrival - but that's a different topic) through uncontrolled airspace

When departing IFR in uncontrolled airspace, it's important you understand your responsibilities as PIC. For example:

*"2132 Bravo is cleared to Bigbob airport, via direct Bobette VOR, V135 OLIVE, V334 STARK. Climb and maintain 3,00 feet.
Contact Departure Control on 127.3, squawk 1234. Clearance void if not off by 1600 Zulu. If not airborne by 1600 Zulu
contact Bigbob Flight Service Station no later than 1630 Zulu."*

We'll work through this clearance piece by piece.

**Void Time**

 - because the controller you're talking to isn't on site, they give you a void time along with the clearance
 - if your **airplane's wheels don't come off the ground** by the void time (1600Z in this case), then the window
   created for that departure closes, and you must contact ATC to advise them
 - the point of this system is to keep airplanes separated - for your departure window the airspace is yours. The second
   the window elapses there may be another aircraft in it (which would be a bad thing if you tried to depart late)
 - **it's not unusual for controllers to offer an immediate departure window with a void time of a few minutes**, so it's
   a good idea to be ready to go when calling up for the clearance
    - you *can* refuse a departure window, and this is a good idea if you're unable to make it or will be rushed
 - **Search and Rescue** (from the AIM, section 5-2-6)
    - a pilot who does not depart prior to the clearance void time must advise ATC as soon as possible of their intentions
    - this time cannot exceed 30 minutes
    - failutre of an aircraft to contact ATC within 30 minutes after their clearance void time will result in
      aircraft being considered overdue and search and rescue procedures initiated

**Heading to the VOR**

 - your clearance takes you from your present position to the Bobette VOR after departure, but it *doesn't tell you how
   to depart the airport safely*
 - you're more than likely departing in to uncontrolled airspace (Class E to 700' to 1,200' initially), which means
   **obstacle avoidance is your responsibility**
 - unless the controller gives you a specific heading to fly immediately after departure, you're on your own to find a
   way to depart safely (which also means you choose your own departure runway)

There are three basic DIY ways of avoiding terrain and obstructions during departure:

 1. Delay departing until you have sufficient visual minimums to see and avoid obstacles in the vicinity. This is a
    good method if you're unfamiliar with the terrain and know there are obstructions surrounding the airport.
 2. Using a sectional chart to decide on an obstruction-free path during an IFR departure in solid IMC. Departing this
    way is a risky proposal at best. For example, what would you do if you encounter icing, RAIM errors, engine
    roughness etc.? This is, however, still a legal option.
 3. The Obstacle Departure Procedure

**Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs)**

 - if the airport has at least one approach, then it's likely to also have an ODP
 - if an ODP exists, it will be found in **Section C at the front of the NACO chart booklet, in the Takeoff-Minimums
   and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures**
 - ODPs are printed either as text, or if it's considered complex, in graphical form as a separate chart, located at the
   end of the approach chart sequence
    - if it's an RNAV ODP it will always be printed graphically
    - if the ODP is printed graphically, the word "(OBSTACLE)" will be printed at the top of the chart
 - the important part is: **ODPs can be used when ATC doesn't specificaly tell you how to depart, *both at towered
   and non-towered airports**
    - typically they're used when departing non-towered airports into uncontrolled (Class G) airspace
 - ODPs can be (and often are) assigned in Class B, C, D, or E airspace, but in Class G they *can't* be assigned because
   ATC has no jurisdiction over that airpsace, *however*
    - ATC may assign an ODP in Class G airspace when it's necessary to prevent a traffic separation problem, such as two
      IFR airplanes departing from two airports close to each other

It's important to remember that towered airports may not be in operation 24 hours a day, in which case they may well
become Class G airspace when the tower's closed.

**Using ODPs that aren't in the direction of the clearance**

*Example: ATC clears you "2132 Bravo is cleared to John Wayne Pilgrim airport via direct Oceanside VOR,..."*

In this case, do you fly directly to the VOR after departing? No, you could use the ODP though. The OCN VOR is to the
*south west* of the airport, but the ODP for departing runway 36 takes you to TANNR intersection, which is *north east*
of the airport. The ODP says to fly to TANNR intersection, and then *".. proceed on course"*.

 - in this case, you would still fly to the TANNR intersection, even though it's in the opposite direction to your
   clearance, then fly any flyable routes to get to OCN
 - if you pop up on ATCs radar going in the 'wrong' direction (ie. away from the OCN VOR), they may wonder what you're
   doing
    - for this reason, it's often good to include the ODP in the flight plan remarks (eg. "Will use RWY 36 ODP")
    - ATC may also often ask if you intend to use the ODP so that they know where to expect you to pop up on radar

**Where do ODPs Exist?**

 - ODPs exist for an airport where there **are obstacles in the departure area**
 - so, what's an 'obstacle' and when is it 'in the area'?
    - when anything penetrates the 152-foot-per-nautical-mile climb plane, known as the *Obstacle Identification Surface*,
      which has a 40:1 slope, starting at 35' above the end of the runway
 - therefore, if you see an ODP published for an airport, then you *know* there must be obstacles somewhere around the
   airport, which is a good reason to take a look at a VFR chart to see what's going on

**Climb Gradients**

 - when a specific climb gradient is *not* specified, it's expected that you climb at **at least 200 foot per nautical mile**
 - this guarantees you an *accumulating* minimum obstacle clearance of 48' per nautical mile

**Turns**

 - some ODPs require a turn after departure
 - in this case, it's assumed that you will **always climb to a minimum altitude of 400'** above the departure end of the
   runway before commencing the turn (unless otherwise stated in the ODP)

**Airports without ODPs**

 - unfortunately, ODPs are not available at all airports because not all airports have instrument approaches
 - this doesn't mean that you can't depart IFR, it just means you'll have to find another way to get out
 - it may be worth talking to airport locals about local obstructions and departure procedures
 - then, it may be a good idea to take out a VFR chart and find the highest obstacle in the departure path. If you use this
   height as your minimum ceiling requirement for the departure, then you should be able to see anything that may get in
   the way, especially along with using at least 1 mile visibility for the departure

# Standard Instrument Departures (SID)

The SID is the other type of instrument departure you're likely to encounter. SIDs are developed to easily communicate
ATC clearances to pilots. It's much easier for a controller to tell you to fly the 'Musel Six Departure' than read
out the entire text of the procedure.

 - SIDs are printed graphically, with an accompanying textual description
 - you don't necessarily need the graphic to fly the SID, but that means that ATC will have to read out all the instructions
   (and you'll have to copy them down)
    - you can also refuse the SID and ask for another means of departure
    - if you **know you don't want to use one in advance**, you can put 'No SIDs/STARs' in the remarks section of your flight
      plan
 - one example of when you might not want to fly a SID is if it takes you far out over water
 - if you **do want to use a SID**, then you can list a SID in your flight plan using the SID codes, just as for STARs, where
   you list the name of the SID, and the fix where you want the SID to terminate
    - *example: flying the MUSEL SIX DEPARTURE to the MUSEL intersection, you'd write MUSEL6.MUSEL in your flight plan*
    - *example 2: flying the MUSEL6 departure to the Daggett VORTAC, you'd list MUSEL6.DAG*

# Non-Standard Takeoff Minimums

While it's important to know the proper IFR departure path, it's equally important to have enough visibility and/or ceiling to
make this possible.

 - **for flights under Part 91, there's no requirement to adhere to any visibility or ceiling requirements during an IFR
   departure.**
    - Part 91 tends to see the pilot as the primary person to assume risk
 - Commercial carriers (Part 121, 123, 129, 135) focus on protecting the innocent passengers
    - these don't have the freedom to depart in in zero-zero conditions
    - they must adhere to any visibility and/or ceiling requirements established for the airprot and runway (plus any of their
      own special, customzed rules, provided by the FAA in their operating specifications)
 - therefore, the FAA has established what is known as **Standard Takeoff Minimums** for all commercial operators
    - for example: commercial operators having two engines or less must have at least one statute mile of visibility
      (RVR of 5,000') for takeoff. Airplanes with more than two engines must have at least one-half statute mile visiblity
      (RVR 2,400') for takeoff
 - there are many airports where the standard takeoff minimums aren't enough to ensure a safe IFR departure, which is where
   the FAA establishes **non-standard takeoff minimums**
 - if you see a **black triangle with a white T in it located in the briefing area**, then that airport has non-standard
   minimums
 - ***even though you're not a commercial operator**, these non-standard minimums tell you that you should exercise caution
   during the IFR departure
    - if you see non-standard takeoff minimums, you can refer to the NACO booklet, Section C, and review them. This will give
      you information about on which runways you can expect obstacles or terrain, and in which direction
    - however, keep in mind that you're not legally (as a Part 91 operator) required to adhere to them

**GPS Sensitivity When Flying a SID**

 - note that GPS should be in **terminal mode** when flying a SID, it should switch automatically but older units may
   need to be changed manually
