# Hypoxia

 - hypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency sufficient to impair functioning of the brain and other organs
 - the amount of oxygen at altitude remains the same (about 21%), but the amount of pressure forcing it into our body decreases
 - effects of hypoxia start as low as 5,000', starting with deteriorated night vision - eyes require a lot of oxygen to function properly
 - other significant effects of hypoxia don't tend to occur in the normal, healthy pilot below 10,000'
 - smoking can greatly decrease the altitude where hypoxia occurs
 - above 10,000', most pilots experience a loss of coordination, judgement, alertness, memory, and ability to perform calculations
 - **Symptoms:**
   - headache, dizzyness, drowsiness, euphoria, tingling in fingertips
 - **TOC:**
   - TOC is the Time Of useful Conciousness
   - TOC is how long you are at least minimally brain functional and useful as a pilot
 - **Prevention:**
   - avoiding flying above 10,000' duing the day or 5,000' at night without supplemental oxygen
   - the FAA specifies regulations for supplemental oxygen use in [FAR 91.211][far91211]

# Hyperventilation

 - hyperventilation is abnormally quick, shallow breathing
 - it can occur if a person is scared, tense, or otherwise stressed
 - rapid breathing has the effect of changing blood chemistry by expelling too much carbon dioxide - the level of carbon dioxide is one of the signals the body uses to regulate breathing
 - **Symptoms:**
   - lightheadedness, drowsiness, suffocation, tingling in the extremeties, and coolness
   - further symptoms (if the initial ones aren't dealt with) could be a lack of coordination, disorientation, and painful muscle spasms, followed by unconsciousness
 - **Treatment:**
   - bring the rate of breathing under control, deep, slow breaths
   - this allows the carbon dioxide levels to build again
   - symptoms disappear within a few minutes
   - talking loudly can be effective in regulating breathing
   - some people recommend breathing deeply into a paper bag

# Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

 - Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas
 - it has a strong affinity for hemoglobin (in your blood) than oxygen. If a CO molecule occupies a hemoglobin molecule, then the oxegyn has nowhere to go and can't be transported in the body
 - CO poisoning is rapid, it can incapacitate quickly and quickly becomes fatal after that
 - the greatest CO danger for a pilot comes from a leak in the exhaust and/or heating - the heater works by circulating air inside a shroud surrounding the hot exhaust pipe
 - CO detectors can be kept in an airplane to indicate the presence of CO
 - if an exhaust gas odour is in the cockpit, especially with the heater on, consider it an emergency. Turn off the heater, open vents, and open windows if possible (consult the airplane's POH)

# Eustachian Tube

 - the Eustachian Tube is a small tube, about an inch long, which connects the middle ear to the nose
 - the middle ear is otherwise sealed, except for the eustachian tube, which provides a two-way conduit between the nose and middle ear
 - the tube permits the middle ear to stay at the same pressure as its surroundings
 - **How it works:**
   - the eustacian tube is normally closed, preventing small changes in pressure or loud noises from affecting the middle ear
   - in an ascent, it temporarily opens to allow the higher pressure in the middle ear to escape and equalise the two pressures
   - in a descent, the air is attempting to force higher pressure air outside into the middle ear, *which is much more difficult*, and can result in the tube staying collapsed
   - nasal congestion can make the problem much worse
   - when the tube remains collapsed and pressure can't be equalized (especially in a descent), this is called an *ear block*
   - if the pressure differential can't be fixed, the higher pressure outside the middle ear pushes the ear drum inward. If there's a high enough differential this can cause the ear drum to rupture (somewhere between excruciating and hellishly painful)
 - **Treatment:**
   - stop the descent, possibly climb back to altitude
   - swallow, yawn, tense your throat muscles, or stick out your jaw. You're attempting to straighten the eustachian tube as much as possible to give it the best chance of opening
   - if that doesn't work, there are two options:
     1. The Valsalva Maneuver: (more common, less good) close your mouth, pinch your nose, and breathe out in short breaths against your closed nose. *This is not recommended and can be damaging*.
     2. The Toynbee Method: (less common, more good) pinch the nose closed, but *swallow* instead of breathing out

It's important to note that it's much harder for children to open their eustachain tube, which is why they're often crying in a descent on a commercial airplane. It can also be very difficult to do with a head cold or any type of nasal congestion.

# IMSAFE

The IMSAFE checklist is used to review psychological and physiological readiness for the flight.

 - **Illness:** any symptoms of illness? This can impair mental and/or physical ability
 - **Mediciation:** taken an prescription or over the counter drugs? Especially check for any warnings about drowsiness
 - **Stress:** are there any situations at home, work, etc. which are adding an amount of stress which might interfere with the successful outcome of the flight? A small amount of stress actually *improves* performance, but everyone has a limit for how much stress is useful.
 - **Alcohol:** have I been drinking in the last 8 hours, the last 24? Legally you can't operate an airplane within **8 hours** of consuming any alcohol. It's usually best to wait 12-24 hours.
 - **Fatigue:** am I tired and not adequately rested?
 - **Eating:** have I eaten enough of the proper foods to keep adequately nourished during the entire flight? Includes water.
