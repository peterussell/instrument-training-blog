 - RNAV is a navigational process allowing point-to-point navigation without requiring that you overfly any navigational aids
 - if you have RNAV equipment on board you can fly direct from one point to another without having to follow traditional navigational routes, ie. airways
 - RNAV is primarily accomplished using either **VOR/DME-RNAV**, or **Global Positioning System (GPS)**
   - modern IFR is usually referring to GPS, although either is valid. We'll cover both.

# RNAV Based on VOR/DME

 - an early type of RNAV equipment used VOR and DME to create moveable, artificial navigational stations known as *waypoints*
 - a waypoint is nothing more than a point in space and use as a spot that you navigate to or from
 - in this instance, it's sort of a virtual VOR
 - most waypoints are defined in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates
 - the main idea is you can use any VOR radial and distance value to define a waypoint
   - this is called *rho-theta* waypoint definition

# The Global Positioning System (GPS)

 - consists of **32 satellites** revolving around the earth in **6 orbital planes**
 - GPS allows you to define waypoints by latitude and longitude
 - GPS unites often tell you where to go by showing the bearing to a waypoint, or providing a CDI on a display similar to a common VOR (or the GPS may be slaved to the omni display - VOR or HSI)
 - GPS units contain databases of coordinates for nearly all important airports, aerial intersections, navigation aids, and other significant places
 - GPS is only one form of aera navigation, for example - airliners have LNAV (Lateral Navigation), FMS (Flight Management Systems), VLF/Omega, and others we've already discussed
   - GPS is most commonly used by general aviation IFR pilots

# Basic GPS Terms

 - **Desired Track (DTK):** the line flown to get between two waypoints
 - **Actual Track (TK):** actual track being flown by the airplane - can diverge from DTK due to wind etc.
 - **Cross Track Error (XTK):** the error between the Desired Track (DTK) and Actual Track (TK)
   - the **XTK is very important**, if an airway's MEA provides 4NM of protection on either side and your XTK is 5 miles, you're in trouble
   - XTK is also valuable when flying RNAV (GPS) instrument approaches, where there's less tolerance for deviation
 - **Bearing (BRG):** the heading you must fly to get to your next waypoint in a *no wind condition*
   - in a no wind condition, the BRG and TK (actual track) should be the same
   - if these values begin to differ then wind is blowing the airplane off course and you need to apply a wind correction
   - you'll know the wind correction is sufficient when the BRG and TK are the same

# Navigating with a GPS

**Before you start: for an installed GPS to be used for IFR enroute and approaches, your flight manual supplement must indicate that this unit is approved for IFR flight. *Handheld GPS units are not legal for IFR enroute and approaches* (although you can certainly use one for situational awareness)**.

*I'll omit some things here about how to set up a GPS unit to fly direct to an airport - assume that this is the scenario - we've entered an airport or navaid and are flying 'Direct' to it. Now, for the interesting parts...*

 - the CDI built into the GPS shows an up arrow with a centered needle if we're flying TO the waypoint and are on course
 - **ENR** (Enroute) is shown as the current flight mode; the CDI is operating with *enroute sensitivity*
   - this means that each dot in the built-in CDI scale represents 1 NM off course for a *non-WAAS GPS unit* (enroute sensitivity is the normal sensitivity for most GPS units)
 - when you fly past the waypoint, the TO/FROM flag flips to FROM, just like a VOR
   - this is called *to/from* navigation, and it's one oftwo course status modes common to GPS units. This is know as the **OBS Mode**
 - the other tracking mode is called *to/to* navigation (referred to as **Leg Mode**
   - in this case, you're flying from one waypoint to another in a sequence, eg. a flight plan with several segments, or an approach made up of multiple waypoints
   - with to/to navigation, the GPS references only the waypoint ahead of you

**Selecting Courses in OBS Mode**

 - with the GPS in OBS mode, you can use the OBS selector to choose the course to the waypoint (just like with a VOR)
 - for example, if you're on the 180 radial flying TO a waypoint (note - it doesn't *have* to be a VOR), you could set the OBS course to 330 with a TO indication
 - as you reach the waypoint and fly over it, the GPS will indicate FROM, just like a VOR

# Flight Plans Made of Several Waypoints

*The same as the previous section, a chunk of this is about how to access and enter waypoints in a flight plan. I'll omit this and get to the good stuff.*

**OBS Mode with a Flight Plan**

 - let's say you were flying direct in **Leg Mode** from one waypoint to the next, but it intersects a Restricted Area
 - you can switch to OBS mode and choose a course for the current leg to navigate around the restricted airspace
 - if you didn't switch to OBS mode, the GPS would continue to indicate Leg Mode
 - **it's important to know and verify which mode your GPS is in**

**Auto-Sequencing**

 - when using Leg Mode, the continuous referencing to the next waypoint is sometimes called *auto-sequencing*
 - this is a particularly important concept for flying GPS approaches (more later)

# Using OBS Mode to Hold

 - you can suspend Leg Mode at any time by pushing the OBS button, which suspends the GPS's auto-sequencing between waypoints in your active flight plan
 - one time this is useful is if ATC wants you to hold at one of your route waypoints, or hold in a direction different than that at which you approach the fix

*Example:* you're asked to hold east of the active waypoint (KSBA) in a direction of 250 degrees inbound

 - if you left the GPS in leg mode, it would automatically sequence to the next waypoint in your flight plan (eg. SFO) as you crossed KSBA. This is why you need to prevent the GPS from auto-sequencing the next waypoint
 - at this point, you can select the route to the *active* waypoint (KSBA)
 - in this case, when cross KSBA you'd rotate the OBS to 250 degrees, and make a right turn outbound to 070 to fly the hold
 - once you're done holding, push the OBS button to return the GPS to Leg Mode and continue on the flight plan

# Other (Misc.) GPS Information

 - to use a GPS when operating on an IFR flight plan (even in VMC), your airplane's *AFM (Airplane/Approved Flight Manual)* must specifically state that it is approved for *IFR enroute and IFR approach operations*
   - note that some GPS units are approved specifically for VFR operations, so be wary that this may be the case
   - handheld GPS units (although very accurate, and even with WAAS capabilities) don't come with FAA approved antenna mountings. Since satellite reception is critical in the enroute and approach environment, the FAA won't certify handheld GPS units for IFR enroute and approach operations
 - effective (and safe) navigation using GPS also means that your navigational and weather databases are current.
   - it also assumes you've obtained the required NOTAMS and checked satellite reception (called **RAIM** - more later) prior to takeoff
 - if you're operating with a certified (non-WAAS capable, TSO-129) GPS unit during IFR enroute and terminal operations, then your airplane must also have an approved and operational *alternate means of navigation* appropriate to flight
   - in most instnaces, this means VOR equipment
   - if you have **RAIM** (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring), you don't need to actively monitor your VOR equipment
   - RAIM predicts the integrity of GPS navigation by predicting satellite availability at the time of your arrival at the destination airport; it offers assurance that the GPS will be available to fly the approach at the destination
   - however, if you **don't have RAIM or your GPS is lost**, then you **must *actively monitor*** the alternate navigation equipment during your approach
   - this means the equipment must be turned on, the station identified, and appropriate approach course selected
