# Basic Requirements
 - at least a 3rd class medical
 - speak, read, write, and understand English

# Knowledge Test
 - 60 multiple choice questions
 - 2 hours 30 minutes
 - score at least 70%
 - must be taken at an FAA-approved test center

# Aeronautical Experience
 - at least 50 hours XC flight time *as PIC* (at least 10 in an airplane, for an airplane IR)
   - XC definition: one landing more than 50nm in a straight line from the point of departure. [AOPA link][aopa-xc-link] (14 CFR 61.1(b)(3)(ii))
      - *note: this definition only applies to XC time for the purposes of applying for an Instrument Rating,
        (or PPL or CPL) - otherwise, **any** flight conducted by a pilot in an aircraft that includes a landing
        at a point other than the point of departure, and includes the use of dead reckoning, pilotage,
        electronic navaids, radio aids, or other systems to navigate to the landing point counts as XC time*
   - touch-and-goes are OK
   - logging PIC time: sole manipulator of the controls of an aircraft for which the pilot is rated or has privileges [AOPA link][aopa-pic-link] (FAR 1.1, 61.51 [e]).
     - Note this is different to *acting* PIC (responsible for the flight)

# Instrument Time
 - at least 40 hours actual or simulated
 - 'Instrument Time': flying solely by reference to the instruments = loggable instrument time
 - at least 15 hours given by a CFII
   - therefore, up to 25 hours with a safety pilot
   - safety pilot must be rated and current the airplane

# Long Instrument XC (FAR 61.65(d)(2)(ii))
 - a minimum of 250nm "along airways or via ATC-directed routing"
 - <del>with at least 1 landing more than 50nm in a straight line from the point of departure</del>
    - *note: the FAR listed above doesn't seem to make any mention of this requirement*
 - requires an instrument approach at each airport on your long XC
 - requires at least 3 types of instrument approaches (GPS, VOR, Localizer, LDA, SDF, NDB, ILS)
 - *not* required to each be at a different airport
