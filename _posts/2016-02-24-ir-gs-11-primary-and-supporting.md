 - 'Primary and Supporting' is second of two common types of instrument scans
 - widely used for IR students in GA airplanes
 - instruments are grouped either as 'Primary' or 'Supporting'
 - they're related to four areas of airplane performance: **pitch, bank, power, trim**

# Pitch Instruments (4):

 - attitude indicator
 - airspeed indicator
 - altimeter
 - VSI

# Bank Instruments (4):

 - attitude indicator
 - heading indicator
 - turn coordinator
 - magnetic compass

# Power Instruments (3):

 - airspeed indicator
 - tachometer
 - manifold pressure indicator

> In each category, for any condition of flight (climb, straight and level, descent, turn, etc.) **there is only one primary instrument**


# Helpful chart to determine primary instruments:

*(there's a graphical depiction and full matrix of these flight conditions in the textbook, which probably make a lot more sense than this..)*

**Instrument Name** / Primary role

 - **Airspeed Indicator** / Power for speed, climb-descend
 - **Attitude Indicator** / Start
 - **Altimeter** / Level
 - **Turn Coordinator** / Turn
 - **Heading Indicator** / Straight
 - **VSI** / Rate
 - **Tach/MP Indicator** / Power

Therefore:

 - primary instruments for **straight and level** are the **heading indicator**, and **altimeter**, and **airspeed indicator** for power (since 'level' assumes a constant airspeed, which is where the 'Power for speed' comes from)
   - supporting instruments for bank are the AI and TC
   - supporting instruments for pitch are the AI and VSI
   - supporting instruments for power are RPM/MP

 - primary instruments for a **level turn** are the **altimeter**, **turn coordinator**, and **airspeed indicator**
   - supporting instruments for pitch are AI and VSI
   - supporting instruments for bank are AI and HI
   - supporting insturments for power are RPM/MP

 - primary instruments for a **straight climb** are the **heading indicator**, **airspeed indicator** (for pitch), and **RPM/MP** for power (since airspeed can't be primary for both pitch and power)
    - there is no supporting power instrument in this case

 - primary instruments for a **stabilized constant rate descent** are **VSI** for pitch, **heading indicator** for bank, and **airspeed indicator** for power (assuming a constant airspeed)
   - the altimeter is **not** a supporting pitch instrument, since it offers no real useful information about the rate of descent

# Changing Airspeeds

When changing airspeeds, the primary power instruments become the **tachometer** and **MP indicator**, and the airspeed indicator becomes a supporting instrument.

Once the power setting is obtained, then the airspeed indicator returns to being the primary instrument (ie. you want to check that the power setting resulted in the correct airpeed).

> In general, when making any major power changes, the RPM/MP gauges temporarily become the primary instruments

# Attitude Transitions

We've discussed primary/supporting instruments for conditions of flight, but not for when beginning the transition between those conditions.

The **attitude indicator** is the primary instrument for either pitch and/or bank during the transition, then it becomes a secondary again once the transition has finished.

Example: transitioning to a level turn from level flight: while rolling into the turn the AI is primary; the heading indicator becomes primary once the turn is established.
