# Primary Navaids

 - non-GPS approaches use a primary navaid, this is the piece of equipment that the approach design is based around (there may be others, but only *one* is the primary)
 - the navaid may or may not be directly aligned with the runway
   - **aligned with a runway:** these have names like VOR Rwy 29, ILS Rwy 11, NDB or GPS Rwy 34. **To be classified as an approach to a a specific *runway*, the approach course must align within 30 degrees of the runway direction.** This value is **15 degrees for a GPS approach**.
   - **not aligned with a runway:** have letters instead of numbers, like VOR-A, NDB or GPS-C, LDA-C, etc. These are approaches to an *airport*, and are called **circling approaches** (because they typically require you to circle to land on a specific runway). These approaches have **circle-to-land minimums**.

# Circling Approaches

 - what happens if we build our approach for one runway, but the prevailing winds on the day we decide to fly favour a different runway?
   - in this case, we will circle to land
   - approach charts provide provisions for *circle-to-land minimums*, which are usually slightly higher minimums than those for a straight-in type of approach
 - many airports also have many instrument approaches, so if the wind favours a different runway you can use the approach to that runway instead of a circle-to-land approach

# Approach Courses vs. Runway Numbers

 - recall that runway IDs omit the last digit of the three-digit direction (eg. runway pointing to 270 is "Runway 27")
 - Runway 27 can actually be anywhere between 266 degrees and 275 degrees, anything between those will be rounded to 27
 - because of this, an inbound approach *aligned with a runway* may not be the same as the runway heading ID
   - *example: Runway 9 at Riverside actually has an orientation of 089 degrees. The approach course is actually 097 degrees due to terrain and other considerations*
 - remember that as long as the approach is within 30 degrees of the runway direction, TERPs criteria allow it to be called a straight-in approach
 - the inbound approach course (and any flyable courses) is depicted with a *bold black line*

# Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE)

 - this is the **highest useable landing surface within the first 3,000' of the runway**

# Course Reversals

 - although ATC often provides vectors to an approach, there's an assumption that the approach can be flown without being in contact with ATC. Therefore, you must be able to get on to the approach structure when approaching from a number of different directions
 - in the case that you're approaching from the *opposite direction* to the approach course, then you'll need to get turned around somehow - this is where a course reversal is handy
 - there are actually *three different ways* of doing this, but for now we'll discuss the **Procedure Turn**

**The '45-180' method:**

 1. make a 45-degree turn off the course
 2. fly for 1 minute
 3. make a 180-degree turn back to intercept the course
 4. track the final approach course inbound to the airport

This actually *isn't mandatory*, anything you can do to get turned around within the permissible area is OK

**Procedure Turn Limitations**

 - a TERPs specialist will look at nearby terrain and establish **a limit from a specific fix or point within which the procedure turn must remain**
 - this limit is normally 10 NM, but it can be different
 - (as far as I can tell) procedure turn limitations are printed in one of the top corners of the **profile view**
 - procedure turn limitations provide you an altitude that keeps you safe at a reasonable distance, while turning, based on the maximum procedure turn speed
   - **Maximum Procedure Turn Speed:** 200 KIAS
   - **Primary Area:** a modified race-track shape, closest to the procedure turn. Provides **1,000'** terrain and obstruction clearance
   - **Secondary Area:** a concentric race-track shape around the primary area. Provides **500'** terrain and obstruction clearance

**Holding Pattern in Lieu of a Procedure Turn**

 - procedure turns require a great amount of space to complete
 - a hold can be used instead of ('in lieu of') a procedure turn as a method to reverse course
 - **a holding pattern must be flown exactly as shown on the chart**

# Short note on the Initial Approach Fix (IAF)

 - IAFs are always labeled on approach charts with the letters IAF in parentheses
 - important for lost communications procedures:
   - you are required, under certain circumstances (more on this later) to proceed to the fix from which an approach begins - the **IAF is this place**

# Chart Profile View

 - the profile view shows sloping lines between points on the approach (intersections etc.) indicating the descent and direction of the approach
 - numbers are displayed at most (all?) points indicating the altitudes required for the approach
   - many altitudes are *underlined*, which specify a **minimum altitude** until that point, ie. you can be at or above that altitude, but not below it
 - it's almost always wise to descend to the lowest altitude permissible on any given portion of an instrument approach for two reasons:
   1. you don't want to have to make a last-minute plunge for the runway
   2. the closer you get to the runway vertically, the better chance you have of seeing it

# Feeder Routes

 - feeder routes exist between navaids, and exist to get you on to the approach structure
 - they almost always include an **altitude, direction, and distance** necessary to transition from one point to the next on a chart
 - these are typically identified by a **medium thick black line** and have the information listed nearby
 - charts usually contain more than one feeder route to allow transitions from other nearby navaids, intersections, and airways on the approach chart
 - it's important to note that **only medium thick lines** (feeder routes), and **maximum thick lines** (initial approach segments and approach procedure tracks) have altitudes and distances associated with them and can be flown using your own navigation
   - said another way, **thin lines are not flyable using your own navigation equipment**
   - these are typically used to identify an intersection or show a VOR radial/course

# Maximum Allowable Limit for Turns

 - **120 degrees** is the is the maximum allowable limit fo turns made **when transitioning from one electronically navigated route to another**

# The Five Segments of an Instrument Approach

Instrument Approaches consist of five parts or segments, each with its own symbols and rules. The basic idea is to take you from wide, expansive airways to smaller, precision-like navigational tunnels. Vertical and horizontal tolerances, speeds, and safety margins all become smaller and more critical as you approach the runway.

 1. **Feeder Route:** takes the aircraft to the IAF
   - IAFs are usually identified on the plan view of the approach chart
 2. **Initial Approach Segment:** starts at the IAF and proceed to the IF (Intermediate Fix)
   - may provide 1,000' of terrain and obstruction clearance
 3. **Intermediate Segment:** starts at the IF and takes you to the FAF (Final Approach Fix)
   - may provide 500' terrain and obstruction clearance
 4. **Final Approach Segment:** starts at the FAF and takes you to the MAP (Missed Approach Point)
   - when the FAF exists, it's **identified on the profile view by a Maltese cross**
   - this is the place where final descent to the lowest minimum altitude on the approach begins
 5. **Missed Approach Segment:** starts at the MAP if you can't meet the legal landing criteria (or decide not to land for other reasons) and takes you to the MAP holding point

# Terrain and Obstructions on the Plan View

 - depicted when terrain **exceeds 4,000' above the airpot elevation**
 - may also be depicted when terrain **exceeds 2,000' within 6NM**
