The time has finally come to start training for an Instrument Rating (IR). The practical part is going to start
in 2016 (still have a little bit more to save, along with moving states and finding a new instructor). In the
meantime it's time to get a bit more serious about studying for the theory portion.

I've got Rod Machado's [Instrument Pilot's Handbook][iph] which is a good complement for my home simulator setup;
together they should make a good base to get familiar with the theory bits. More than one CFI I've talked to
has mentioned that students with a lot of simulator time tend to progress through the Instrument Rating faster
compared to ones that don't. The dream is reduce the time it takes to complete the actual training (and paying for actual airplane time). Most importantly though, is being safe and thorough.

I'll be keeping notes here as a reference for later, as well as to make sure I've absorbed the concepts and
can regurgitate them in my own words.

For now the notes will be for the theory portion as I work through the text, but I'm hoping I can find time
during the practical training to keep a track of what's covered in each lesson.
