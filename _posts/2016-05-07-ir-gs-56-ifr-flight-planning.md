A bunch of different factors need to be considered while planning and executing an IFR flight. Just
because you have an IFR cert doesn't allow you to fly in any conditions. For example, icing conditions
along your route of flight, combined with cloud tops and bottoms that mean you'll be in them make
up a situation where you should probably (read: definitely) stay grounded.

We'll run through a bunch of different factors that need to be considered, starting with the PIC.

# IFR Pre-flight Planning

**PIC**

 - start by considering physiological and phsycological factors, you can use IMSAFE as a guide
 - instrument currency:
    - am I legally current (6 approaches, holds, course interception and tracking within 6 months)
    - am i proficient? If you haven't done an approach in 5 months an 29 days, you're legal, but
      you should probably go shoot approaches with an instructor and get proficient again before
      loading up for an IFR trip
    - note: military pilots must fly at least every 14 days or undergo extensive recurrent training,
      which can be used as a good baseline. You really should be flying approaches frequently after
      getting your IR

**Airplane**

 - is the airplane legal for IFR flight?
    1. do the **transponder**, **altimeter**, and **altitude reporting equipment** have current
       24-calendar month inspections?
    2. is the **altimeter accurate +/- 75'** based on a known elevation (note: 75' is an AIM *recommendation*)
    3. is the **GPS database** current if you're planning to list a /G equipment suffix?
    4. have you done a **VOR accuracy check** in the last 30 days?
    5. are the **annual**, **100 hour**, and **ELT**, and any **ADs** current?
    6. are the **airplane documents** in order?
    7. is there any **inop equipment** on the airplane that needs to be placarded? Is this inop
       equipment required for VFR or IFR flight? (remember, of the 6 panel instruments, only the VSI
       isn't required, but if it's inop it still needs to be placarded)
    8. is the airplane within W&B?

**A Big-Picture Look at the Weather**

 - a **few days before** an IFR flight, it's a good idea to start watching the weather channel to obtain a
   bigger picture of the trends going on. This shows big trends, as well as whether the weather is
   happening as predicted
 - the **day before** is a good time to call the FSS and ask for an outlook briefing, or doing this
   by computer
 - we'll cover more specifics about the weather briefing, but getting the big picture up to the day before
   the flight is the main idea here

**An Initial Selection of IFR Routing**

 - remember, your carefully selected IFR route may all be for naught if the controller gives you
   something different. That said...
 - **First**, check for the existence of any **Preferred Routes**
    - if they exist, the best place to find them is in the rear sectino of the Chart Supplement (A/FD)
    - ATC defines Preferred Routes because it enables them to maximize traffic flow, minimize delays,
      and sometimes keep you out of other airspace
    - preferred routes provide **altitudes and routings, as well as *effective times***
    - preferred routes **beginning with a fix** indicate that departing airplanes will often be routed
      to that fix by a DP or radar vector
    - high-altitude preferred routes are also listed in the Chart Supplement when available
    - *if preferred routes are available for your direction of flight, you're likely to get them
      regardless of what you filed*
    - there may be times when you don't want preferred routes, which we'll cover later
 - **Tower Enroute Control (TEC) Routes**
    - recall from an earlier post that flights within a TEC environment have their own form of
      preferred routing, called TEC Routes (also sometimes called **tower-to-tower clearance**)
    - these are **also listed in the back of the Chart Supplement**
    - make sure you file these when operating in a TEC environment

**NACO IFR/VFR Low Altitude Flight Planning Chart**

  - one of thoe most useful tools in helping you make your initial route selection
  - it shows all the low altitude airways and important navaids
  - airports in blue have 1+ IAPs, brown don't, and red are private airports
  - from what I can tell, the biggest advantage this publication is the *straight-line distance
    legend*
     - this shows the straight-line NM distance between two points
     - it can come in handy when making an initial assessment of the number of stops you'll need
       to make, and where to make them

**Intersection IFR Departures**

 - it's possible to file an IFR flight plan from a point other than the departure airport
 - you can file a flight plan to begin at an intersection, navaid, or waypoint in the nearby enroute
   structure
 - you may use this if you expect to fly VFR for a portion of the flight
 - in this case, you'll **call ATC to get your IFR clearance while in VFR conditions** as you approach
   the departure *point*
 - you can get the correct frequency by looking on the IFR enroute chart and selecting the nearest
   center frequency

# Getting Down to Details

Now we have a rough idea of the weather, route, and distance, we'll start getting into specifics the closer
we get to the flight.

 - within 6 hours of your departure, based on your latest assessment of the weather, is the time
   to make your final route selection
 - you'd usually go as direct as possible, but things such as weather, navaid outages, etc. may dictate
   a different route

**Dealing with an Undesirable Route**

 - even when you file your desired route, the ATC computer may not necessarily give it to you
 - for example, if you're filing specifically to avoid thunderstorms, then get given a route assigned
   directly through the thunderstorms, you need to do something about it
 - at this point, it's best to ask Clearance Delivery (or whoever is giving you the clearance) to
   intercede on your behalf
 - there are times where it's better off accepting ATC's routing then negotiating with the Center
   controller while aloft for modified routing
    - this, of course, only works well if the thing you're trying to avoid is further down the road,
      not immediately after departure

# Filing Direct Routes

 - why would you want to fly airways when you might be able to fly direct from one fix to another? It's
   often much more efficient to fly a direct routing when you have the equipment (eg. /G for an IFR approved
   GPS) and when ATC permits you to
 - if you only have VOR equipment, then you can file from one VOR direct to another, even if no airways
   exist between the two
    - you can do this **below 18,000' if those VORs are within 80 NM or less of each other** (this is the
      typical service volume limit of 'L' class VORs)
 - **what altitude would you choose?**
    - review your *sectional* charts and pick an altitude 1,000' (or 2,000' in designated mountainous
      terrain) **above the highest obstacle and within 4NM of your anticipated course centerline**
    - alternatively, you could look at your low altitude enroute chart and **pick the highest OROCA**
      which provides terrain clearance of 1,000'/2,000'
    - then, you'd want to **modify that altitude based on magnetic course to be flown**
