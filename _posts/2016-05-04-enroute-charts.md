# Low Altitude Enroute Chart Overview

 - provides information to fly in the IFR enroute structure **below 18,000' MSL**
 - used from the time you depart an airport until you arrive at a location covered by an approach chart
 - there are **18 double sided charts** (think 18,000' MSL, 18 charts), giving 36 charts total in the
   low altitude enroute system
 - mileage scales vary from 1"=8NM to 1"=20NM, the scale is shown on the front cover
 - the charts are **revised every 56 days** (same as the NACO approach chart booklets)
    - the effective dates are shown on the front cover along with the scale for the chart
    - *example: "Effective 0901Z 5 Aug 2016 to 0901Z 30 Sep 2016"

# Area Charts

 - in addition, there are 13 **Area Charts** available for high-traffic density areas in the US
 - these show a smaller region in greater detail
 - may show intersections and waypoints that may not exist on the low altitude enroute chart
 - a list of cities that have area charts is shown in black lettering on the chart coverge panel (the panel
   that shows which areas of the US are covered by which charts)

# High Altitude Enroute Charts

 - the airspace at and above 18,000' MSL is covered by the **High Altitude Enroute Chart**
 - shows things such as the jet route structure, VHF NAVAIDs, selected airports, and reporting points
 - they have a larger scale, (1"=18NM to 1"=45NM), there are only **6 high altidude enroute charts**,
   totaling 12 chart sides
 - these are **also revised every 56 days**

# Airport Locations Tab

 - the Airport Locations Tab lists the names of airports on a chart, along with the panel name that it
   can be found on
    - *example: "Fort Morgan Muni / FMM / Panel F" means that KFFM can be found on Panel F of the chart*

# Military Training Routes (MTRs)

 - since NACO charts are also used by the military, they depict MTRs on the chart itself, as well as
   listing them on the front of the chart
 - the list on the front of the chart shows the route number and altitudes
 - MTRs are **shown in brown with number IDs on them** (eg. VR-125, IR-133)
 - MTR route depictions are shown by either a thin or thick brown line:
    - **Thick MTR route:** the route is greater than 5NM on at least one side of the line
    - **Thin MTR route:** the route is less than 5NM on both sides of the line
 - MTR information isn't much practical vlaue for civilian IFR flight, ATC provides separation between
   military and civilian traffic, although...
 - one circumstance where they can be useful is if you're departing through uncontrolled airspace that
   lies on on near an active MTR

# Airport Depiction

 - the low altitude enroute chart shows **all airports having hard surface runways of 3,000' or longer,
   and/or having an IAP** (in Alaska both hard or soft runways > 3,000' are shown)
 - **airports *with* an IAP** are either **blue or green**
 - **airports *without* an IAP** are **brown**
 - the difference between blue and green airports is a historical difference to do with whether there were
   military procedures (blue) at the field or not (green), meaning you had to look at different booklets
   to find the procedures. This isn't relevant any more - all the procedures are published in the NACO
   booklet now, and this difference will eventually go away

**City Names vs. Airport Names on Enroute Charts**

 - public airports are identified by city name *and* the associated airport name, when the city name
   is different to the airport name
 - this is important when looking up the approaches in the approach chart booklet, *you may need to look
   up the airport under the **city** name instead of the airport name*
    - *example: 'Brackett Field' is listed under 'La Verne, CA' in the NACO booklet, not under 'Brackett'

**Airspace Depiction**

 - a **D in a box next to an asterisk** means that part-time Class D airspace exists at the airport
 - dashed airspace lines aren't depicted on enroute charts, so the D symbol shows the type of airspace
   that exists at the airport
    - I'm assuming that the asterisk is what denotes the 'part time', but need to check
 - if you see this, then you need to check the A/FD to see when the Class D is in effect
 - **use caution when planning an IFR flight to an airport at a time when its surface-based controlled
   airspace is not in effect**
    - approach minimums can sometimes increase, and may even be prohibited
    - other airports may not be authorized for filing as alternates during this time
    - *example: Oxnard (OXR) can't be listed as an alternate when the tower is closed or when
      local weather isn't available*

**Note: you can still list an alternate - even if it doesn't have an instrument approach - if you can
descend and land in VFR conditions from the local, appropriate mininmum airway altitude (MEA and MOCA,
which we'll discuss later).**

# Special Use Airspace

 - special use airspace is decpicted on the low altitude enroute chart in a similar way to VFR sectional
   charts
 - the conditions, altitudes, and active times are shown in the border panel of the chart
 - **MOA:** closely spaced hatched brown lines
    - flight through an MOA is *not* restricted, but still worth checking if it's hot before entering
 - **Restricted:** closely spaced hatched blue lines

**MOA 'Aerodrome Traffice Zone'**

 - this is a brown solid circle around an airport that's inside a MOA
 - all airspace within thes circle (typically **less than 1,500' AGL** - but noted on the chart) is
   **not part of the MOA**

**Remote Communications Outlets**

 - RCOs are depicted as small circles with a dot inside, associated with a name for the station and
   frequency (and sometimes a specific receiving name)
 - these are outlets connected to FSS, providing flight plan filing/opening/closing, etc.
 - you'd call Albequerque FSS like so on 122.35:
    - *"Albuquerque Radio, Cessna 2132 Bravo, Salt Flat VOR (unless there's a specific name attached to
      the RCO), 122.35"*
    - the reason for providing location and frequency is because the FSS specialist is probably controlling
      multiple RCO outlets, so it lets them know which one to call you back on

# ATC Boundaries

 - the boundaries of ARTCCs (Air Route Traffic Control Centers) are **depicted by zig-zag lines**
 - on either side of the line is the name of the ARTCC facility responsible for the area on either side
 - near the border, there's a box called the **ARTCC box** - these contain the frequencies you can use
   to contact the ARTCC facility on that side of the border
    - these frequencies are called **Sector discrete frequencies**
 - these can be used to obtain pop-up IFR clearances, or to activate the IFR part of a composite flight
   plan

# Navigational Stations

 - **VOR/DME:** triangle inside a square box
    - the UHF TACAN identifier and its 2 or 3 digit channel number (eg. '41') also indicates DME availability
 - **VORTAC:** triangle with three blocks, one attached to each corner
 - **TACAN (UHF azimuth and DME *without VHF azimuth*):** empty VORTAC symbol
    - only really useful if you have TACAN equipment, which is usually military
 - **VOR (no DME):** the six-sided VOR symbol indicates no DME capability

**Reporting Requirements for Navaids**

 - if the triangle inside a VOR symbol (note VOR/DME, VORTAC, VOR will all be referred to as 'VOR') contains
   a **filled black triangle** then it's a **compulsory** reporting point
 - if the triangle is empty, or there is no triangle, then the VOR is a **non-compulsory** reporting point

# Chart Overlap

 - low altitude enroute charts overlap each other
 - the edge of each chart is labeled with the next chart to use when crossing the border of the current one
 - the cover of the low altitude chart also shows the charts and how they overlap each other

**Airways and Navaids when Switching Charts**

 - where an airway leaves the border (eg. V-56) of a chart, *outside* the border will list the nearest
   navaid supporting that airway that's on the next chart
 - this way you can look at the chart border *before you switch* to figure out which navaid you'll be
   looking for to continue tracking the airway you're on
 - this works the same for intersections as well (eg. OZMOS will be listed *outside* the border for V198-222)
