Many instrument approaches incorporate *DME arc transitions*. Instead of flying a straight-line navigational route onto the primary approach structure, the DME arc provides you with a curved path (arc) to fly that aligns you wit h the approach. These arcs are circular with a specified distance from the DME station.

 - you fly a DME arc by selecting radials and flying perpendicular to them
 - when approaching the arc and get to .5 NM away, start the turn in the direction you want to fly along the arc (standard = left arc?). If flying faster than about 150kts you may want to lead the turn earlier.
 - turn until you're on a heading 90 degrees from your inbound intercept heading:
   - *Example: if you're inbound on a 270 heading (ie. on a 090 radial TO), and are doing a left-circling arc, turn right to 000*
 - the concept behind flying a DME arc is that you're tuning in successive radials that intersect the arc you're flying, you're then turning to intercept each radial at a 90 degree intercept angle
 - each time you intercept a radial, turn it 20 degrees more so that it is set to the next radial you want to intercept, then turn the airplane to intercept *that* radial at 90 degrees

**Example:**

*If your inbound radial is 090 (270 heading) and the arc is a left arc (ie. going around it counterclockwise), and your final radial (the radial that defines the end of the arc, eg. where the ILS is) is 010. The DME arc is 10 NM from the VOR:*

 - fly inbound on 270 until 0.5 NM from the DME arc
 - turn right to a heading of 090 (90 degrees from the inbound course)
 - set the next radial. Because we're flying left around the arc, the next radial we want to intercept is the 070 radial
 - turn the plane so that it's at a 90 degree intercept heading. An easy way to figure this out is to look at the VOR and use the course at 90 degrees to the current setting as the heading you should aim for. In this case: fly 340 (90 degrees left of 070)
 - fly until the needle centers (ie. you're intercepting at 90 degrees)
 - adjust the OBS to intercept the next radial - in this case, the 050 radial
 - turn the airplane to intercept at 90 degrees - in this case a heading of 320
 - during this, **keep checking the DME**. If you're too close to the DME (ie. less than 10 miles), shallow out the intercept headings - in our case, turn to the right of a 90 degree intercept heading. If you're too far away, you need to steepen the intercept angle (ie. fly 'more toward' the DME)
 - keep repeating these steps until you get to the radial defining the end of the arc. At this point continue on (eg. fly inbound on the radial). In our case, once we tuned in the 010 radial and crossed, we would be finished.

**Your objective should be to keep within 1 mile of the arc.**
