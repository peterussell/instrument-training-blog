# Precision vs. Non-Precision Approaches
An ILS approach involves lateral and vertical guidance. Vertical guidance is provided by a glideslope. Any type of approach that utilizes a glideslope is called a **precision approach**. Procedures *without* glideslopes, such as ordinary VOR approaches, are called **non-precision approaches**.

Precision approaches typically offer you a better chance of landing under reduced visibility because they guide you to a lower altitude, and can place you in a better position from which a landing is more likely.

The most common type of precision approach is called the *Instrument Landing System (ILS)* approach.

# Components of an ILS Approach

The ILS consists of four components:

 1. A **localizer:** provides horizontal guidance
 2. A **glideslope:** provides vertical guidance, usually down a 3 degree glideslope
 3. **Marker Beacons:** to help mark or identify your range along the approach path
 4. **Approach Lights:** help you transition from instrument to visual flight

# The Localizer

 - the localizer is a **single** electronic course aligned with the runway centerline
 - you track it the same as a VOR, except the localizer offers much more accurate horizontal guidance, meaning the designers of an ILS can allow you to descend further, since you're confined to a tighter horizontal space
 - transmitters are typically at the **far end of the runway**
 - the **localizer width** is typically 3 to 6 degrees, as opposed to 20 degrees for a VOR
   - **Variation in width**: the width is varied due to runways being different lengths, it's set between 3 and 6 degrees so it provides a width of **approximately 700 feet at the landing threshold**

**Identifying the Localizer**

 - localizers transmit between 108.1 and 111.95MHz, in odd tenths only
 - the localizer (Morse code) identifier is preceded by an 'I' (two dots), eg. the Chino 26R ILS is identified by the Morse code for I-CNO

**It's possible to listen to voice transmissions on the localizer.** This would come in handy if you lost reception on your comm radios - you could still receive ATC instructions when flying an ILS.

**In all lost communication events, you want to keep your nav radio volume turned up in case ATC is trying to reach you over nav frequencies.**

# Navigating Using the Localizer

 - when you tune a localizer course the CDI indicates whether the airplane's position is left or right of the selected course (like a VOR)
 - rotating the OBS has no affect on the selected course, but it's good practice to set it to the inbound course as a reminder
 - the localizer antenna is located at the end of the approach runway, so CDI sensitivity increases as you approach the antenna
 - when executing a *missed approach* you'll often overfly the antenna and continue outbound, in this case there is **no reverse sensing**

**Localizer Backcourse (BC) Approach**

 - flying the localizer backcourse is the same as VOR reverse sensing - you fly *away* from the needle to re-center it
 - **BC Switch:** some airplanes have a back course switch (often labeled *BC*) which compensates for the reverse sensing
 - **HSIs** aren't affected the same way because the compass card always orients relative to the OBS setting
 - **Autopilots:** autopilots on some airplanes have a BC switch which allows the autopilot to track inbound on the back-course localizer and lock out the glideslope - *back-course approaches don't use the glideslope* (makes sense if you think about it for a second..), any glideslope indication you see is invalid and must be ignored

# The Glideslope

 - the Glideslope is an electronic beam **angled upward between 2.5 to 4 degrees, with an average angle of 3 degrees**
 - to fly a fully ILS approach (localizer & glideslope) you need either an HSI or ILS omni display that provides two needles: one for horizontal guidance, and one for vertical
 - the vertical needle indicates where the glideslope is in relation to your airplane - if the needle is above center, then glideslope is above you. If the needle is below center, the glideslope is below you
 - when the needle is centered, you're on the glideslope and should begin a descent at a rate that keeps the needle centered
 - the key to keeping the glideslope centered is using the **VSI as the primary pitch instrument**
 - *both the localizer and glideslope operational status is indicated by the appearance of warning flags or symbols on the instrument*

**The Glideslope Signal**

 - the antenna generating the glideslope signal is located **750 - 1,250 feet from the approach end of the runway**, and **400-600 feet off to one side of the centerline**
 - the ground-based transmitter transmits a signal over UHF
 - glideslope receivers are somewhere that maintain line-of-sight with the ground-based antenna, often on the sides of the horizontal stabilizer or front of the windscreen

**Glideslope Sensitivity**

 - the glideslope is more sensitive than both a VOR or localizer signal
 - the glideslope's beam is **approximately 1.4 degrees wide**

**TDZE (etc.)**

 - pilots normally fly the glideslope down to **approximately 200' Height Above Touchdown (HAT)**, which is the height of the runway's **TDZE - or TouchDown Zone Elevation**
 - the **TDZE** represents the highest point of the runway during the first 3,000' of its length
 - the glideslope is angled to keep you away from obstructions - if there are high obstructions near the airport then the angle may be greater than 3 degrees, if there a few obstructions it may be as low as 2.5 degrees

**Receiving False Glideslope Signals**

 - you may be able to receive glideslope signals at vertical angles higher than that for which it was approved, but it's **not an *accurate* glideslope indication** and should be ignored
 - angles between 9-12 degrees tend to be where false glideslope signals are received
 - this is why ATC and approaches typically try to set you up to intercept the glideslope from below
 - at approximately **3,500' from the threshold, a normal glideslope will be at a vertical distance of approximately 200'**
 - at **4-7 miles, it will be approximately 1,500'**
