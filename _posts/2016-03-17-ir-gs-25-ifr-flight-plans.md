# Filing an IFR Flight Plan

 - filing an IFR flight plan means communicating with the AFSS (Automated Flight Service Station) either in person, over the phone, via radio, or via the internet, and providing them with a completed flight plan
 - keep in mind that a VFR flight plan is intended for search and rescue purposes. The route (and all other data) you file in a VFR flight plan **isn't sent to ATC**, but kep on file by the FSS to be used in the event of a search
 - the route (and other info) in an IFR flight plane **does go to ATC** (for obvious reason)
 - we'll cover *how* to file a flight plan later

 - the IFR flight plan you file provides the FSS specialist with information on:
   - your aircraft
   - destination
   - route
   - altitudes
   - fuel on board
   - etc.
 - the computer works on this information, checks for traffic conflicts, flow control, routing, and weather, and finally issues an IFR clearance in the name of your airplane's tail number
 - it waits in the Center computer until an FSS sepciailist of ATC controller pulls it up at your request (or it may automatically arrive on their desk a sepcific time before your proposed departure time)
 - because of the time it takes to complete all this, you're ask to file an IFR flight plan **at least 30 minutes in advance of the time you'd like to receive your clearance**

# Picking up an IFR clearance

 - you'll typically pick up an IFR clearance on the ground, preferably after your airplane is preflighted and ready to go
 - call the nearest AFSS via phone or radio, or call the ground controller via radio if departing from a tower controlled airport
 - the controller will read you your IFR clearance
 - you read the clearance back to verify it's correct

# Filed Routes vs. Actual Routes

 - you'll notice that the Center's computer often gives you a route that doesn't look anything like the one you asked for in your original flight plan
 - sometimes this is just the way it goes, the Center's computer will calculate the route that works best with the rest of the IFR system
 - if you get a route that really doesn't work for you, you can negotiate with ATC
 - eg.
   - you call Clearance Delivery or Ground Control and say *'Divit Clearance, this is N2132 Bravo, request pre-filed IFR clearance to Lobrain airport'*
   - the controller responds by saying to standby, that the clearance is *on request*
   - **Clearance On Request** means the controller is doing the work to request your clearance from the Center's computer, where the clearance is sitting. When the controller receives the clearance, they'll call you and ask if you're reading to copy
   - you advise when you can copy it, the controller reads it to you while you copy it, then read it back to verify
   - this is the time to carefully look over the clearance, check all the airways are there, it gets you to the correct destination, etc.
   - this is also the time to negotiate the clearance, better to do it on the ground than in the air
   - for example, you may get a clearance that takes you over water, when you filed a route that wasn't over water because you don't have a flotation device. It would be reasonable to ask the controller to request a better route for you (although you'll have to wait for it to be changed)
   - other times you may not be able to get it modified due to what else is going on in the IFR system. In that case it may be the best option to deal directly with Center while in the air

 - if you're at an **non-towered airport** and the route you get isn't acceptable, then the FSS specialist is the person to talk to in an attempt to get something better worked out

# Non-Towered Airport Departures

 - if you're departing IFR from an airport that doesn't have a tower (or has one that's closed), your IFR clearance will normally be delivered to the FSS, Center, or Approach facility nearest the point of departure
 - a quick look at your IFR approach and/or enroute chart will help you identify this facility
 - when departing a non-towered airport, you're normally given a **departure window** as part of the IFR clearance. This is a time period within which you *must* launch
   - for example, a clearance may end with *'clearance void if not off by 1315Z, if not off by 1315 advise Albuquerque not lter than 1345 of intentions. Time is now 1305."
 - **don't take off after the depature window** - you're no longer guaranteed sole occupancy of the airspace

# No-Gos

 - if you're a no-go for any reason, **you are obligated to notify ATC within 30 minutes** that you didn't make thte departure window
 - this is a search and rescue provision

# Tower Enroute Control (TEC)

 - a lot of IFR flights begin and end entirely within approach/departure control airspace - for example, in Southern California airplanes regularly fly IFR from one airport to another and don't need to go high enough to enter Center's airspace (6,000' MSL - 60,000' MSL)
 - this is great for ARTCC, who are generally very busy
 - these flights are conducted within something called *Tower Enroute Control (TEC)*
 - TEC is for pilots who want to file IFR **within overlapping individual approach and departure control jurisdictions**
   - in areas *not* covered by these approach control facilities, Center assumes responsibility
 - TEC clearances aren't available from Center
 - under TEC, airplanes stay away from Center's airspace and generally operate below 10,000' MSL
 - they start out and remain the responsibility of one or more contiguous (touching) approach control facilities
 - the key word is **contiguous** - TEC works as long as you can be passed from one approach controller to another
   - if there's a gap that's Center-controlled, your TEC ride is often over
 - in a few parts of the country (LA for example) you can call the tower and ask for an IFR clearance to any other airport within the TEC area. Instead of having to file an IFR flight plan with the FSS 30 minutes prior, you only need to make a radio request to the tower and wait a couple of minutes. You just tell them you want a Tower Enroute Clearance to airport x.

 - TEC offer pilots a number of additional advantages, for example:
   - because the flights are often close to radar sites, the flights can usually be conducted with less separation (remember, 3 miles separation within 40 miles of the tower antenna, 5 miles otherwise)
   - Approach Control's radar is generally more sensitive in detecting weather. With radar antennas closer to a pilot's position, weather radar returns are more defined and precise. This is valuable when trying to pinpoint specific convective activity in IFR conditions
   - similarly, because other pilots in the TEC are generally closer than with Center, PIREPs are fresher, more accurate depiction of the weather

 - keep in mind that if the tower controllers are too busy, you may be asked to file a flight plan with the nearest FSS
