 - 'Control and Performance' is one of the two common types of instrument scans
 - often used by pilots flying high performance airplanes
 - categorizes instruments as either Control, Performance, or Navigation
   - **Control**
     - attitude indicator
     - power instruments (RPM/MP)
   - **Performance**
     - airspeed indicator
     - heading indicator
     - altimeter
     - VSI
     - magnetic compass

> Airplane Control: attitude and power = performance

 - places an emphasis on the **attitude indicator**
 - attitude changes are made solely by reference to the **attitude indicator**; power changes are made with reference to the tachometer or mainfold pressure gauge
 - once attitude and power conditions are selected, airplane is trimmed to remove any pressure from flight controls
 - then performance is observed using control instruments to verify the changes made using the attitude indicator had the desired effect

**Example** *using Control and Performance to make an attitude change:*

 1. establish the attitude and power for a desired condition (eg. returning to straight and level from a climb)
 2. trim for hands-off flight
 3. cross-check performance instruments to verify settings are giving the desired performance
 4. adjust attitude or power if necessary
 5. the process of observing control and performance instruments is repeated until the desired flight performance is obtained
